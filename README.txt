1. AlfredThesis
   Alfred's thesis, generally useless later.

2. dataset
   1) citation data: ????? 
      From XXXXXX, we get this data set. But we did not use this.)
   2) citeseer_manual: manually labeled dataset from Chuan on 64 articles
   3) webkb: web pages, and their links. 
      From XXXXXX, we get this data set. But we did not use this.)

3. doc
   Experimental results from Laura Dietz

4. project
   The source code implemented by Huiping
   The function does not consider the influence aspects

5. project_dietz
   The source code downloaded from Dr. Dietz's website
    No change.

6. project_ta
   The source code implemented by Chuan Hu.
   The function considers both influence aspects and influence degrees.
   -- Draw samples in each iteration
      Have both implementations: (1) loop, (2) use map for o'
   -- Initial sampling: loop 
   -- In order to repeat the results in May 2013, can use this
   -- This is an earlier version of "project in git repository"
      virtually useless now. 
   -- All the twitter data, running results used for this project are under this folder

7. resultsummary
   -- results for May 2013 version.

======================
8. project in git repository
   Compared with project_ta
   -- Draw samples in each iteration 
   -- Initial sampling: change from loop to map iterations
   -- Also implements the sparse LDA for o' (not for o yet).
      But we did not report results on this aspect yet. 
   -- In order to repeat the results in May 2013, can use this repository
   -- In order to repeat the results in Oct 2013, can use this repository

   -- The more detailed information, please see the README file for the git repository
