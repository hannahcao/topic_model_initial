citer abstract:in recent years, privacy preserving data mining has become an important problem because of the large amount of personal data which is tracked by many business applications. in many cases, users are unwilling to provide personal information unless the privacy of sensitive information is guaranteed. in this paper, we propose a new framework for privacy preserving data mining of multi-dimensional data. previous work for privacy preserving data mining uses a perturbation approach which reconstructs data distributions in order to perform the mining. such an approach treats each dimension independently and therefore ignores the correlations between the di erent dimensions. in addition, it requires the development of a new distribution based algorithm for each data mining problem, since it does not use the multi-dimensional records, but uses aggregate distributions of the data as input. this leads to a fundamental re-design of data mining algorithms. in this paper, we will develop a new and  exible approach for privacy preserving data mining which does not require new problem-specific algorithms, since it maps the original data set into a new anonymized data set. this anonymized data closely matches the characteristics of the original data including the correlations among the di erent dimensions. we present empirical results illustrating the e ectiveness of the method

citee title:data swapping: balancing privacy against precision in mining for logic rules
citee abstract:the recent proliferation of data mining tools for the analysis of large volumes of data has paid little attention to individual privacy issues. here, we introduce methods aimed at finding a balance between the individuals�� right to privacy and the data-miners�� need to find general patterns in huge volumes of detailed records. in particular, we focus on the data-mining task of classification with decision trees. we base our security-control mechanism on noise-addition techniques used in statis tical databases because (1) the multidimensional matrix model of statistical databases and the multidimensional cubes of on-line analytical processing (olap) are essentially the same, and (2) noise-addition techniques are very robust. the main drawback of noise addition techniques in the context of statistical databases is low statistical quality of released statistics. we argue that in data mining the major requirement of security control mechanism (in addition to protect privacy) is not to ensure precise and bias-free statistics, but rather to preserve the high-level descriptions of knowledge constructed by artificial data mining tools.

citee abstract:much of the research in inductive learning concentrates on problems with relatively small amounts of data. with the coming age of ubiquitous network computing, it is likely that orders of magnitude more data in databases will be available for various learning problems of real world importance. some learning algorithms assume that the entire data set fits into main memory, which is not feasible for massive amounts of data, especially for applications in data mining. one approach to handling a large data set is to partition the data set into subsets, run the learning algorithm on each of the subsets, and combine the results. moreover, data can be inherently distributed across multiple sites on the network and merging all the data in one location can be expensive or prohibitive.  in this thesis we propose, investigate, and evaluate a meta-learning approach to integrating the results of multiple learning processes. our approach utilizes machine learning to guide the integration. we identified two main meta-learning strategies: combiner and arbiter. both strategies are independent to the learning algorithms used in generating the classifiers. the combiner strategy attempts to reveal relationships among the learned classifiers' prediction patterns. the arbiter strategy tries to determine the correct prediction when the classifiers have different opinions. various schemes under these two strategies have been developed. empirical results show that our schemes can obtain accurate classifiers from inaccurate classifiers trained from data subsets. we also implemented and analyzed the schemes in a parallel and distributed environment to demonstrate their scalability

citee title:on the accuracy of meta-learning for scalable data mining
citee abstract:in this paper, we describe a general approach to scaling data mining applications that we have come to call meta-learning. meta-learning refers to a general strategy that seeks to learn how to combine a number of separate learning processes in an intelligent fashion. we desire a meta-learning architecture that exhibits two key behaviors. first, the meta-learning strategy must produce an accurate final classification system. this means that a meta-learning architecture must produce a final outcome that is at least as accurate as a conventional learning algorithm applied to all available data. second, it must be fast, relative to an individual sequential learning algorithm when applied to massive databases of examples, and operate in a reasonable amount of time. this paper focussed primarily on issues related to the accuracy and efficacy of meta-learning as a general strategy. a number of empirical results are presented demonstrating that meta-learning is technically feasible in wide-area, network computing environments.

citee title:a secure protocol for computing dot products in clustered and distributed environments
citee abstract:dot-products form the basis of various applications ranging from scientific computations to commercial applications in data mining and transaction processing. typical scientific computations utilizing sparse iterative solvers use repeated matrix-vector products. these canbe viewed as dot-products of sparse vectors. in database applications, dot-products take the form of counting operations. with widespread use of clustered and distributed platforms, these operations are increasingly being performed across networked hosts. traditional apis for messaging are susceptible to sniffing, and the data being transferred between hosts is often enough to compromise the entire computation. for example, in a domain decomposition based sparse solver, the entire solution can often be reconstructed easily from boundary values that are communicated on the net. in yet other applications, dot-products may be performed across two hosts that do not want to disclose their vectors, yet, they need to compute the dot-product. in each of these cases, there is a need for secure and anonymous dot-productprotocols. due to the large computational requirements of underlying applications, it is highly desirable that secure protocols add minimal overhead to the original algorithm. finally, by its very nature, dot-products leak limited amounts of information ? one of the parties can detect an entry of the other party's vector by simply probing it with a vector with a 1 in a particular location and zeros elsewhere. given all of these constraints, traditional cryptographic protocols are generally unsuitable due to their significant computational and communication overheads. in this paper, we present an extremely efficient and sufficiently secure protocol for computing the dot-product of two vectors using linear algebraic techniques. using analytical as well as experimental results, we demonstrate superior performance in terms of computational overhead, numerical stability, and security. we show that the overhead of a two-party dot-product computation using mpi as the messaging api across two high-end workstations connected via a gigabit ethernet approaches multiple 4.69 over an unsecured dot-product. we also show that the average relative error in dot-products across a large number of random (normalized) vectors was roughly 4:5 �� 10-9.

citee title:masking microdata files
citee abstract:government agencies collect many types of data, but due to confidentiality restrictions, use of the microdata is often limited to sworn agents working on secure computer systems at those agencies. these restrictions can severely affect public policy decisions made at one agency that has access to nonconfidential summary statistics only. this necessitates creation of microdata which not only meets the confidentiality requirements but also has sufficient utility. this paper describes a general methodology for producing public-use data files that preserves confidentiality and allows many analytical uses. the methodology masks quantitative data using an additive-noise approach and then, when necessary, employs a reidentification/swapping methodology to assure confidentiality. one of the major advantages of this masking scheme is that it also allows obtaining precise subpopulation estimates, which is not possible with other known masking schemes. in addition, if controlled distortion is applied, then a prespecified subset of subpopulation estimates from the masked file could be nearly identical to those from the unmasked file. this paper provides the theoretical underpinning of the masking methodology and the results of its actual application using examples.

citee title:measures of disclosure risk and harm
citee abstract:disclosure is a difficult topic. even the definition of disclosure depends on the context. sometimes it is enough to violate anonymity. sometimes sensitive information has to be revealed. sometimes a disclosure is said to occur even though the information revealed is incorrect. this paper tries to untangle disclosure issues by differentiating between linking a respondent to a record and learning sensitive information from the linking. the extent to which a released record can be linked to a respondent determines disclosure risk; the information revealed when a respondent is linked to a released record determines disclosure harm. there can be harm even if the wrong record is identified or an incorrect sensitive value inferred. in this paper, measures of disclosure risk and harm that reflect what is learned about a respondent are studied, and some implications for data release policies are given.
surrounding text:an example in [14]<1> illustrates the identification by linking a medical data set and a voter list using fields like zip code, date of birth and gender.  in addition to the identity disclosure problem discussed above, attribute disclosure occurs when something about an individual is learnt from the released data [***]<1>.  attribute disclosure can happen even without identity disclosure

citee title:protecting respondents' identities in microdata release
citee abstract:today��s globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination and sharing of information. while in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call today for the release of specific data (microdata). in order to protect the anonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. de-identifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and zip code, that can be linked to publicly available information to re-identify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. in this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of the respondents to which the data refer. the approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. a table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. we illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. we introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not to distort the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. we also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.

citee title:elements of statistical disclosure control
citee abstract:statistical disclosure control is the discipline that deals with producing statistical data that are safe enough to be released to external researchers. this book concentrates on the methodology of the area. it deals with both microdata (individual data) and tabular (aggregated) data. the book attempts to develop the theory from what can be called the paradigm of statistical confidentiality: to modify unsafe data in such a way that safe (enough) data emerge, with minimum information loss. this book discusses what safe data, are, how information loss can be measured, and how to modify the data in a (near) optimal way. once it has been decided how to measure safety and information loss, the production of safe data from unsafe data is often a matter of solving an optimization problem. several such problems are discussed in the book, and most of them turn out to be hard problems that can be solved only approximately. the authors present new results that have not been published before. the book is not a description of an area that is closed, but, on the contrary, one that still has many spots awaiting to be more fully explored. some of these are indicated in the book. the book will be useful for official, social and medical statisticians and others who are involved in releasing personal or business data for statistical use. operations researchers may be interested in the optimization problems involved, particularly for the challenges they present. leon willenborg has worked at the department of statistical methods at statistics netherlands since 1983, first as a researcher and since 1989 as a senior researcher. since 1989 his main field of research and consultancy has been statistical disclosure control. from 1996-1998 he was the project coordinator of the eu co-funded sdc project

citee title:improving web search efficiency via a locality based static pruning method
citee abstract: the  unarguably  fast,  and  continuous,  growth  of  the  volume of  indexed  (and  indexable)  documents  on  the  web  poses  a great   challenge   for   search   engines this   is   true  regarding not  only  search   e ectiveness  but  also   time  and  space  e  - ciency in  this  paper  we  present  an  index  pruning  technique targeted  for   search  engines  that  addresses   the  latter  issue without  disconsidering  the  former to  this  e ect,  we  adopt a  new  pruning  strategy  capable  of  greatly  reducing  the  size of   search  engine  indices experiments  using   a  real  search engine  show  that  our  technique  can  reduce  the  indices'  stor - age   costs   by  up  to   60%   over   traditional   lossless   compres - sion  methods,   while  keeping  the  loss  in  retrieval  precision to   a   minimum when   compared   to   the   indices   size   with no  compression  at  all,  the  compression  rate  is  higher  than 88%,   i e ,   less   than   one   eighth   of   the   original   size more importantly,  our  results  indicate  that,  due  to  the  reduction in  storage  overhead,  query  processing  time  can  be  reduced to   nearly   65%   of   the   original   time,   with   no   loss   in   aver - age  precision the  new  method  yields  signi cative  improve - ments  when  compared  against  the  best  known  static  prun - ing  method  for  search  engine  indices in  addition,  since  our technique is  orthogonal  to  the  underlying search  algorithms, it  can  be  adopted  by  virtually  any  search  engine
surrounding text:indices containing positional information are di erent in nature and not easily accessible to the pruning techniques described here (de moura et al.  [***]<2> present a possible approach).  our method is not suitable for phrase queries and other query forms that require the existence of positional information in the index, however, it can be used to perform bag-of-words search operations, in conjunction with scoring functions such as okapi bm25 [13]<2> and certain implementations of language-model-based retrieval functions [2]<2>. based on fagin's method, de moura et al.  [***]<2> propose a locality-based pruning technique that, instead of only taking the highest-scoring postings into the pruned index, selects all postings corresponding to terms that appear in the same sentence as one of the postings selected by fagin's method.  their experimental results indicate that this locality-enhanced version of the pruning algorithm outperforms the original version

citee title:self-indexing inverted files for fast text retrieval
citee abstract:query processing costs on large text databases are dominated by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. here we show that query response time for conjunctive boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be dramatically reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each inverted list. this method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. our experimental results show that the selfindexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the inverted file, but, for boolean queries of 5{10 terms, can reduce processing time to under one fifth of the previous cost. similarly, ranked queries of 40{50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval e ectiveness

citee abstract:the article presents text retrieval research results in the areas of automatic ad hoc retrieval, information filtering, vlc (very large collections) and interactive retrieval. for automatic ad hoc retrieval, three runs were submitted: medium (title and description), short (title only) and a run which was a combination of a long run (title, description and narrative) with the medium and short runs. the average precision of the last mentioned run was higher by several percent than any other submitted run, but another participant recently noticed an impossibly high score for one topic in the short run. this led to the discovery that due to a mistake in the indexing procedures part of the subject field of the la times documents had been indexed. use of this field was explicitly forbidden in the guidelines for the ad hoc track. the official runs were repeated against a corrected index, and the corrected results are presented, average precisions being reduced by about 2-4%. in the area of adaptive filtering, efforts focused on the twin problems of: (a) starting from scratch, with no assumed history of relevance judgments for each topic, and (b) having to define a threshold for retrieval. for vlc, four runs on the full database were submitted, together with one each on the 10% and 1% collections. in the area of interactive retrieval, two pairwise comparisons were made: okapi with relevance feedback against okapi without, and okapi without against zprise without.

citee title:compression of inverted indexes for fast query evaluation
citee abstract:compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries. in this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency: better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. first, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency. in experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results: use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact golomb-rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the cpu cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead: the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10% of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%. we conclude that fast byte-aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists

citee abstract:considerable research effort has been invested in improving the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. techniques such as relevance feedback, thesaural expansion, and pivoting all provide better quality responses to queries when tested in standard evaluation frameworks. but such enhancements can add to the cost of evaluating queries. in this paper we consider the pragmatic issue of how to improve the cost-effectiveness of searching. we describe a new inverted file structure using quantized weights that provides superior retrieval effectiveness compared to conventional inverted file structures when early termination heuristics are employed. that is, we are able to reach similar effectiveness levels with less computational cost, and so provide a better cost/performance compromise than previous inverted file organisations.
surrounding text:even with an efficient representation of postings [16]<2>, the list for a common term can require several megabytes for each gigabyte of indexed text.  worse, heuristics such as frequencyordering [13]<2> or impact-ordering [***]<2> are not of value, as the frequency of a word in a document does not determine its frequency of participation in a particular phrase.  a crude solution is to use stopping, as is done by some widely-used web search engines (the google search engine, for example, neglects common words in queries), but this approach means that a small number of queries cannot be evaluated, while many more evaluate incorrectly [12]<2>

citer abstract:search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast, a challenging task given the vast quantities of data being indexed. a significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases. in this paper we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads. previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes, but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files. we propose a combination of nextword indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem. our experiments show that combined use of an auxiliary nextword index and a conventional inverted file allow evaluation of phrase queries in half the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone, and the space overhead is only 10% of the size of the inverted file. further time savings are available with only slight increases in disk requirements. general terms indexing, query evaluation keywords inverted indexes, nextword indexes, evaluation efficiency, index size, stopping, phrase query

citee title:self-indexing inverted files for fast text retrieval
citee abstract:query processing costs on large text databases are dominated by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. here we show that query response time for conjunctive boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be dramatically reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each inverted list. this method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. our experimental results show that the selfindexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the inverted file, but, for boolean queries of 5{10 terms, can reduce processing time to under one fifth of the previous cost. similarly, ranked queries of 40{50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval e ectiveness
surrounding text:a simple heuristic to address this problem is to directly merge the inverted lists rather than decode them in turn.  on the one hand, merging has the disadvantage that techniques such as skipping [***]<2> cannot be as easily used to reduce processing costs (although as we discuss later skipping does not necessarily yield significant benefits).  on the other hand, merging of at least some of the inverted lists is probably the only viable option when all the query terms are moderately common. o sets only have to be decoded when there is a document match, but they still have to be retrieved.  other techniques do have the potential to reduce query evaluation time, in particular skipping [***]<2>, in which additional information is placed in inverted lists to reduce the decoding required in regions in the list that cannot contain postings that will match documents that have been identified as potential matches.  on older machines, on which cpu cycles were relatively scarce, skipping could yield substantial gains

citee title:indexing by latent semantic analysis
citee abstract:a new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. the approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (��semantic structure��) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. the particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 or- thogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are re- turned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.

citee abstract:describes compression methods for components of full-text systems such as text databases on cd-rom. topics discussed include storage media; structures for full-text retrieval, including indexes, inverted files, and bitmaps; compression tools; memory requirements during retrieval; and ranking and information retrieval.
surrounding text:without compression, an inverted file can easily be as large or larger than the text it indexes.  compression results in a net space reduction of as much as 80% of the inverted file size [***]<1>, but even with fast decompressiondecoding at approximately 400,000 numbers per second on a sun sparc 10it involves a substantial overhead on processing time.  here we consider how to reduce these space and time costs, with particular emphasis on environments in which index compression has been used. 1 compressing inverted files techniques for compressing inverted lists, or equivalently bitmaps, have been described by many authors, including bell et al .

citee title:model based concordance compression
citee abstract:the authors discuss concordance compression using the framework now customary in compression theory. they begin by creating a mathematical model of concordance generation, and then use optimal compression engines, such as huffman or arithmetic coding, to do the actual compression. it should be noted that in the context of a static information retrieval system, compression and decompression are not symmetrical tasks. compression is done only once, while building the system, whereas decompression is needed during the processing of every query and directly affects the response time. one may thus use extensive and costly preprocessing for compression, provided reasonably fast decompression methods are possible. moreover, compression is applied to the full files (text, concordance, etc.), but decompression is needed only for (possibly many) short pieces, which may be accessed at random by means of pointers to their exact locations. therefore the use of adaptive methods based on tables that systematically change from the beginning to the end of the file is ruled out. however, their concern is less the speed of encoding or decoding than relating concordance compression conceptually to the modern approach of data compression, and testing the effectiveness of their models

citee title:retrieving records from a gigabyte of text on a minicomputer using statistical ranking
citee abstract:statistically based ranked retrieval of records using keywords provides many advantages over traditional boolean retrieval methods, especially for end users. this approach to retrieval, however, has not seen widespread use in large operational retrieval systems. to show the feasibility of this retrieval methodology, research was done to produce very fast search techniques using these ranking algorithms, and then to test the results against large databases with many end users. the results show not only response times on the order of 1 and l/2 seconds for 806 megabytes of text, but also very favorable user reaction. novice users were able to consistently obtain good search results after 5 minutes of training. additional work was done to devise new indexing techniques to create inverted files for large databases using a minicomputer. these techniques use no sorting, require a working space of only about 20% of the size of the input text, and produce indices that are about 14% of the input text size.
surrounding text:processing of these values produces little increase in accuracy and is expensive, particularly in systems that use compression for inverted lists, since, to evaluate queries, large volumes of data have to be decompressed.  there have been many attempts to improve the efficiency of ranked query evaluation [2, 4, ***, 8, 10]<2>.  elimination of stop-wordsthat is, of very frequent words or closed-class words such as \and" and \of"is often used to reduce the number of uninformative terms processed. more sophisticated algorithms implement some dynamic stopping condition.  the typical approach taken by these algorithms is to order terms in a query by decreasing weight, and then process terms in this order until some stopping condition is met [2, ***, 8, 10]<2>.  mo at and zobel [10]<2> implemented the stopping condition by limiting the number of accumulators. the second version gave the same retrieval e ectiveness as a basic version that processed all inverted lists, and in conjunction with a modification to the index structure discussed below approximately halved processing time.  harman and candela [***]<2> experimented with another pruning algorithm.  they accumulated partial similarities given by all documents in all inverted lists (like the second algorithm by mo at and zobel) but limited the number of accumulators by setting a condition for the insertion of new documents into the set of relevant documents: their algorithm only considered those documents which contained terms with inverse document frequency more than a certain fraction of the maximum inverse document frequency of any term in the database. in other words, the thresholds provide a mechanism for tuning system load.  thresholds have previously been used to decide whether to process or reject whole inverted lists [***]<2>, but not to decide whether to process or reject individual documents.  the values of both thresholds for a term t are determined as a function of the accumulated partial similarity of the currently most relevant document smax. other term weighting systems the cosine measure as described in section 2 is not the only similarity measure.  there are other similarity measures, for example those described by lucarella [8]<2> and harman and candela [***]<2>.  we tested the robustness of document filtering by applying it to these similarity measures

citer abstract:compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries. in this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency: better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. first, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency. in experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results: use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact golomb-rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the cpu cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead: the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10% of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%. we conclude that fast byte-aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists

citee title:highly scalable parallel algorithms for sparse matrix factorization
citee abstract:in this paper, we describe scalable parallel algorithms for sparse matrix factorization, analyze their performance and scalability, and present experimental results for up to 1024 processors on a cray t3d parallel computer. through our analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate that our algorithms substantially improve the state of the art in parallel direct solution of sparse linear systems - both in terms of scalability and overall performance. it is a well known fact that dense matrix factorization scales well and can be implemented efficiently on parallel computers. in this paper, we present the first algorithms to factor a wide class of sparse matrices (including those arising from two- and three-dimensional finite element problems) that are asymptotically as scalable as dense matrix factorization algorithms on a variety of parallel architectures. our algorithms incur less communication overhead and are more scalable than any previously known parallel formulation of sparse matrix factorization. although, in this paper, we discuss cholesky factorization of symmetric positive definite matrices, the algorithms can be adapted for solving sparse linear least squares problems and for gaussian elimination of diagonally dominant matrices that are almost symmetric in structure. an implementation of one of our sparse cholesky factorization algorithms delivers up to 20 gflops on a cray t3d for medium-size structural engineering and linear programming problems. to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance ever obtained for sparse cholesky factorization on any supercomputer.
surrounding text:however, even msb can take a large amount of time.  in particular, in parallel direct solvers, the time for computing ordering using msb can be several orders of magnitude higher than the time taken by the parallel factorization algorithm, and thus ordering time can dominate the overall time to solve the problem [***]<2>.  another class of graph partitioning techniques uses the geometric information of the graph to find a good partition. surprisingly, our scheme substantially outperforms the multiple minimum degree algorithm [35]<2>, which is the most commonly used method for computing fill-reducing orderings of a sparse matrix.  even though multilevel algorithms are quite fast compared with spectral methods, they can still be the bottleneck if the sparse system of equations is being solved in parallel [32, ***]<2>.  the coarsening phase of these methods is relatively easy to parallelize [30]<2>, but the kl heuristic used in the refinement phase is very difficult to parallelize [16]<2>. bars under the baseline indicate that mlnd performs better than mmd.  elimination trees produced by mmd (a) exhibit little concurrency (long and slender) and (b) are unbalanced so that subtree-to-subcube mappings lead to significant load imbalances [32, 12, ***]<2>.  on the other hand, orderings based on nested dissection produce orderings that have both more concurrency and better balance [27, 22]<2>

citee title:modification of the minimum degree algorithm by multiple elimination
citee abstract:the most widely used ordering scheme to reduce fills and operations in sparse matrix computation is the minimum-degree algorithm. the notion of multiple elimination is introduced here as a modification to the conventional scheme. the motivation is discussed using the k-by-k grid model problem. experimental results indicate that the modified version retains the fill-reducing property of (and is often better than) the original ordering algorithm and yet requires less computer time. the reduction in ordering time is problem dependent, and for some problems the modified algorithm can run a few times faster than existing implementations of the minimum-degree algorithm. the use of external degree in the algorithm is also introduced.
surrounding text:we also used our graph partitioning scheme to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices.  surprisingly, our scheme substantially outperforms the multiple minimum degree algorithm [***]<2>, which is the most commonly used method for computing fill-reducing orderings of a sparse matrix.  even though multilevel algorithms are quite fast compared with spectral methods, they can still be the bottleneck if the sparse system of equations is being solved in parallel [32, 18]<2>. on a parallel computer, a fill-reducing ordering, besides minimizing the operation count, should also increase the degree of concurrency that can be exploited during factorization.  in general, nested dissectionbased orderings exhibit more concurrency during factorization than minimum degree orderings [13, ***]<2>.  the minimum degree [13]<2> ordering heuristic is the most widely used fill-reducing algorithm that is used to order sparse matrices for factorization on serial computers. the minimum degree algorithm has been found to produce very good orderings.  the multiple minimum degree algorithm [***]<2> is the most widely used variant of minimum degree due to its very fast runtime.  the quality of the orderings produced by our mlnd algorithm compared with that of mmd is shown in table 8 and figure 7

citee abstract:in this paper we consider the problem of partitioning large sparse graphs, such as finite element meshes. the heuristic which is proposed allows to partition into connected and quasi-balanced subgraphs in a reasonable amount of time, while attempting to minimize the number of edge cuts. here the goal is to build partitions for graphs containing large numbers of nodes and edges, in practice at least 104. basically, the algorithm relies on the iterative construction of connected subgraphs. this construction is achieved by successively exploring clusters of nodes called fronts. indeed, a judicious use of fronts ensures the connectivity of the subsets at low cost: it is shown that locally, i.e. for a given subgraph, the complexity of such operations grows at most linearly with the number of edges. moreover, a few examples are given to illustrate the quality and speed of the heuristic.

citee title:partitioning sparse matrices with eigenvectors of graphs
citee abstract:the problem of computing a small vertex separator in a graph arises in the context of computing a good ordering for the parallel factorization of sparse, symmetric matrices. an algebraic approach to computing vertex separators is considered in this paper. it is shown that lower bounds on separator sizes can be obtained in terms of the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix associated with a graph. the laplacian eigenvectors of grid graphs can be computed from kronecker products involving the eigenvectors of path graphs, and these eigenvectors can be used to compute good separators in grid graphs. a heuristic algorithm is designed to compute a vertex separator in a general graph by first computing an edge separator in the graph from an eigenvector of the laplaeian matrix, and then using a maximum matching in a subgraph to compute the vertex separator. results on the quality of the separators computed by the spectral algorithm are presented, and these are compared with separators obtained from automatic nested dissection and the kernighan-lin algorithm. finally, we report the time required to compute the laplacian eigenvector, and consider the accuracy with which the eigenvector must be computed to obtain good separators. the spectral algorithm has'the advantage that it can be implemented on a medium size multiprocessor in a straight forward manner.

citer title:a fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs
citer abstract:recently, a number of researchers have investigated a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduce the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, partition the smaller graph, and then uncoarsen it to construct a partition for the original graph . from the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not known if they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. we investigate the e ectiveness of many di erent choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. in particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. we also present a much faster variation of the kernighan{lin (kl) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. we test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, vlsi, and transportation. our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm

citee title:towards a fast implementation of spectral nested dissection
citee abstract:the authors describe the novel spectral nested dissection (snd) algorithm, a novel algorithm for computing orderings appropriate for parallel factorization of sparse, symmetric matrices. the algorithm makes use of spectral properties of the laplacian matrix associated with the given matrix to compute separators. the authors evaluate the quality of the spectral orderings with respect to several measures: fill, elimination tree height, height and weight balances of elimination trees, and clique tree heights. they use some very large structural analysis problems as test cases and demonstrate on these real applications that spectral orderings compare quite favorably with commonly used orderings, outperforming them by a wide margin for some of these measures. the only disadvantage of snd is its relatively long execution time
surrounding text:the graph partitioning problem is np-complete, however, many algorithms have been developed that find a reasonably good partition.  spectral partitioning methods are known to produce good partitions for a wide class of problems, and they are used quite extensively [45, ***, 24]<2>.  however, these methods are very expensive since they require the computation of the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue (fiedler vector). in the absence of extensive data, we could not have done any better anyway.  in table 9 we show three di erent variations of spectral partitioning [45, ***, 26, 2]<2>, the multilevel partitioning described in this paper, the levelized nested dissection [11]<2>, the kl partition [31]<2>, the coordinate nested dissection (cnd) [23]<2>, two variations of the inertial partition [38, 25]<2>, and two variants of geometric partitioning [37, 36, 15]<2>.  for each graph partitioning algorithm, table 9 shows a number of characteristics

citee title:dynamic source routing in ad hoc wireless networks
citee abstract:an ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without theaid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. in such an environment, it may benecessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination,due to the limited range of each mobile host��s wireless transmissions. this paper presents a protocolfor routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. the protocol adapts quickly to routingchanges when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in whichhosts move less frequently. based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating inan ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as hostdensity and movement rates. for all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead ofthe protocol is quite low, falling to just 1% of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement ratesin a network of 24 mobile hosts. in all cases, the difference in length between the routes used and theoptimal route lengths is negligible, and in most cases, route lengths are on average within a factor of 1.01of optimal.
surrounding text:while link-state algorithms provide the capability for multipath routing, the time and communication overhead associated with maintaining full topological knowledge at each router makes them impractical for this environment as well.  some existing algorithms which have been developed for this environment include the following: the gafnibertsekas (gb) algorithms [10]<2>, the lightweight mobile routing (lmr) protocol [11]<2>, the destination-sequenced distance vector (dsdv) routing protocol [12]<2>, the wireless routing protocol (wrp) [13]<2>, and the dynamic source routing (dsr) protocol [***]<2>.  while these algorithms are better suited for this environment, each has its drawbacks

citee title:time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system
citee abstract:the concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.
surrounding text:the results would be the same.  an excellent analysis on the ordering of events in a distributed system is provided in [***]<1>.  while the details will not be covered here, suffice it to say that simply establishing the order of events does not require the use of physical clocks

citee title:a distributed routing algorithm for mobile radio networks
citee abstract:we present a distributed routing protocol for mobile packet radio networks. the protocol is intended for use in networks where the rate of topological change is not so fast as to make ��flooding�� the only possible routing method but not so slow as to make one of the existing protocols for a static topology applicable. the roue ing algorithm adapts asynchronously in a distributed fashion to arbitrary changes in topology in the absence of global topological knowledge. the protocol maintains a set of loop-free routes to each destination from any node that desires a route. the protocol��s performance, measured in terms of end-to-end packet delay and throughput, is compared with both that of pure flooding and an alternative algorithm which is well-suited to the mediumrate topological change environment envisioned here. the results show that when the rate of topological changes becomes very high flooding is preferable to the other alternatives. for lower rates of change, it appears that when the effects of channel access are account, ed for, the performance of the new algorithm is encouraging in that it has been generally superior to that of the alternative protocols
surrounding text:a possible enhancement to the protocol would be to periodically propagate refresh packets outwards from the destination, reception of which resets the reference level of all nodes to zero and restores distance significance to their di ��s.  the usage of periodic, destination-initiated, route optimization was mentioned as a possible routing enhancement in [***]<2> and, later, a similar technique was developed as the major mechanism for route adaptation and maintenence in [12]<2>.  besides serving as a routing enhancement, the periodic refresh guarantees that router state errors��resulting from undetectable errors in packet transmissions or other sources��do not persist for arbitrary lengths of time

citer abstract:one of the important types of information on the web is the opinions expressed in the user generated content, e.g., customer reviews of products, forum posts, and blogs. in this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. in particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. this problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. most existing techniques utilize a list of opinion (bearing) words (also called opinion lexicon) for the purpose. opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. these approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. in this paper, we propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. this approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. it also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. it also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. a system, called opinion observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. it outperforms existing methods significantly

citee title:extracting product features and opinions from reviews
citee abstract:consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews in order to make an informed product choice. this paper introduces opine, an unsupervised information-extraction system which mines reviews in order to build a model of important product features, their evaluation by reviewers, and their relative quality across products.compared to previous work, opine achieves 22% higher precision (with only 3% lower recall) on the feature extraction task. opine's novel use of relaxation labeling for finding the semantic orientation of words in context leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity.
surrounding text:it is thus highly desirable to produce a summary of reviews [13, 21]<2> (see below and also section 3).  in the past few years, many researchers studied the problem, which is called opinion mining or sentiment analysis [1, 3, 13, 15, ***, 37]<2>.  the main tasks are (1) to find product features that have been commented on by reviewers and (2) to decide whether the comments are positive or negative. asking a domain expert or user to provide such knowledge is not scalable due to the huge number of products, product features and opinion words.  several researchers have attempted the problem [11, 16, ***]<2>.  however, their approaches still have some major limitations as we will see in the next section. a related method is used in [17]<2>.  these methods are improved in [***]<2> by a more sophisticated method based on relaxation labeling.  we will show in section 5 that the proposed technique performs much better than both these methods. it is more flexible.

citee title:efficient algorithms for creating product catalogs
citee abstract:for the purposes of this paper we define a catalog to be a promotional catalog, i.e., a collection of products (items) presented to a customer with the hope of encouraging a purchase. the single mailing problem addresses how to build a collection of catalogs and distribute them to customers (one per customer) so as to achieve an optimal outcome, e.g., the most profit. each catalog is a subset of a given set of items and different catalogs may contain some of the same items, i.e., catalogs may overlap. a slightly more general, but important extension of the single mailing problem seeks the optimal set of catalogs when multiple mailings are allowed, i.e., multiple catalogs can be sent to each customer. catalog creation has important applications for e-commerce and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, especially when used with personalized recommender systems. the catalog creation problem is np complete and some (relatively expensive) approximation algorithms have recently been developed. in this paper we describe more efficient techniques for building catalogs and show that these algorithms outperform one of the previously suggested approaches. (indeed, the techniques previously suggested are not feasible for realistic numbers of customers and catalogs.) some of our techniques directly use the objective function, e.g., maximize profit, to find a locally optimal solution in an approach based on gradient ascent. however, by combining such techniques with the clustering of similar customers, better results can sometimes be obtained. we also analyze the performance of our algorithms with respect to a theoretical bound and show that, in some cases, their performance is close to optimal.
surrounding text:the microeconomic framework for data mining has in particular been investigated for segmentation (clustering) problems where the enterprise does not make an optimal decision per individual customer but chooses one optimal decision per customer segment.  catalog segmentation, a specialized segmentation problem, has received considerable attention [6, 7, ***]<2>: the enterprise wants to design k product catalogs of size r that maximize the overall customer purchases after having sent the best matching catalog to each customer1.  the catalog segmentation problem measures the utilityo f a customer in terms of catalog products purchased. in the data mining community, the catalog segmentation problem has been treated as a clustering problem.  steinbach et al [***]<2> show that the sampling-based enumeration algorithm[6]<2> is infeasible for realistic problem sizes.  instead, theyp ropose two alternative heuristic algorithms and a hybrid algorithm (hcc) combining both of them. the real dataset records the purchasing transactions of the customers of a large canadian retailer over a period of several weeks.  since the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem has not yet been addressed in the literature, we compare our proposed algorithms with one of the state-oftheart algorithms [***]<2> for the related catalog segmentation problem.  we choose dcc as our comparison partner because of the following two reasons. we choose dcc as our comparison partner because of the following two reasons.  first, the experimental evaluation in [***]<2> showed that dcc, together with hcc, achieved the highest qualityre sults.  second, dcc scales better to large customers databases than hcc because dcc can, different from hcc, use storage efficient adjacencyl ists instead of an adjacencymat rix

citer abstract:the microeconomic framework for data mining  assumes that an enterprise chooses a decision maximizing the overall utility over all customers where the contribution of a customer is a function of the data available on that customer. in catalog segmentation, the enterprise wants to design k product catalogs of size r that maximize the overall number of catalog products purchased. however, there are many applications where a customer, once attracted to an enterprise, would purchase more products beyond the ones contained in the catalog. therefore, in this paper, we investigate an alternative problem formulation, that we call customer-oriented catalog segmentation, where the overall utility is measured by the number of customers that have at least a specified minimum interest t in the catalogs. we formally introduce the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem and discuss its complexity. then we investigate two different paradigms to design efficient, approximate algorithms for the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem, greedy (deterministic) and randomized algorithms. since greedy algorithms may be trapped in a local optimum and randomized algorithms crucially depend on a reasonable initial solution, we explore a combination of these two paradigms. our experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates that the new algorithms yield catalogs of significantly higher utility compared to classical catalog segmentation algorithms

citee abstract:mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds ofdatabases has been studied popularly in data mining research. most of the previous studies adopt an apriori-likecandidate set generation-and-test approach. however, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when thereexist a large number of patterns and/or long patterns.in this study, we propose a novelfrequent-pattern tree(fp-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-treestructure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient fp-tree-based mining method, fp-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth.efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a condensed,smaller data structure, fp-tree which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our fp-tree-based mining adoptsa pattern-fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) apartitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks formining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. our performancestudy shows that the fp-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns,and is about an order of magnitude faster than the apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reportednew frequent-pattern mining methods.

citee title:a finite algorithm to maximize certain pseudoconcave functions on polytopes
citee abstract:this paper develops and proves an algorithm that finds the exact maximum of certain nonlinear functions on polytopes by performing a finite number of logical and arithmetic operations. permissible objective functions need to be pseudoconcave and allow the closed-form solution of sets of equations  , which are first order conditions associated with the unconstrained, but affinely transformed objective function. examples are pseudoconcave quadratics and especially the homogeneous functioncx +m(xvx)1/2,m < 0, v positive definite, for which sofar no finite algorithm existed. in distinction to most available methods, this algorithm uses the internal representation of the feasible set to selectively decompose it into simplices of varying dimensions; linear programming and a gradient criterion are used to select a sequence of these simplices, which contain a corresponding sequence of strictly increasing, relative and relatively interior maxima, the greatest of which is shown to be the global maximum on the feasible set. to find the interior maxima on these simplices in a finite way, calculus maximizations on the affine hulls of subsets of their vertices are necessary; thus the above requirement that  be explicitly solvable. the paper presents a flow structure of the algorithm, its supporting theory, its decision-theoretic use, and an example, computed by an apl-version of the method.

citee abstract:epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the nervous system. the progressive entrainment between an epileptogenic focus and normal brain areas results to transitions of the brain from chaotic to less chaotic spatiotemporal states, the epileptic seizures. the entrainment between two brain sites can be quantified by the t-index from the measures of chaos (e.g., lyapunov exponents) of the electrical activity (eeg) of the brain. by applying the optimization theory, in particular quadratic zero-one programming, we were able to select the most entrained brain sites 10 minutes before seizures and subsequently follow their entrainment over 2 hours before seizures. in five patients with 3�c24 seizures, we found that over 90% of the seizures are predictable by the optimal selection of electrode sites. this procedure, which is applied to epilepsy research for the first time, shows the possibility of prediction of epileptic seizures well in advance (19.8 to 42.9 minutes) of their occurrence.

citee abstract:this paper presents a page rank-based prefetching technique for accesses to web page clusters. the approach uses the link structure of a requested page to determine the "most important" linked pages and to identify the page(s) to be prefetched. the underlying premise of our approach is that in the case of cluster accesses, the next pages requested by users of the web server are typically based on the current and previous pages requested. furthermore, if the requested pages have a lot of links to some "important" page, that page has a higher probability of being the next one requested. an experimental evaluation of the prefetching mechanism is presented using real server logs. the results show that the page rank-based scheme does better than random prefetching for clustered accesses, with hit rates of 90% in some cases.

citee title:words with attitude
citee abstract:the traditional notion of word meaning used in natural language processing is literal or lexical meaning as used in dictionaries and lexicons. this relatively objective notion of lexical meaning is different from more subjective notions of emotive or affective meaning. our aim is to come to grips with subjective aspects of meaning expressed in written texts, such as the attitude or value expressed in them. this paper explores how the structure of the wordnet lexical database might be used to assess affective or emotive meaning. in particular, we construct measures based on osgood��s semantic differential technique.

citee title:on the bursty evolution of blogspace
citee abstract:we propose two new tools to address the evolution of hyperlinked corpora. first, we define time graphs to extend the traditional notion of an evolving directed graph, capturing link creation as a point phenomenon in time. second, we develop definitions and algorithms for time-dense community tracking, to crystallize the notion of community evolution. we develop these tools in the context of blogspace , the space of weblogs (or blogs). our study involves approximately 750k links among 25k blogs. we create a time graph on these blogs by an automatic analysis of their internal time stamps. we then study the evolution of connected component structure and microscopic community structure in this time graph. we show that blogspace underwent a transition behavior around the end of 2001, and has been rapidly expanding over the past year, not just in metrics of scale, but also in metrics of community structure and connectedness. this expansion shows no sign of abating, although measures of connectedness must plateau within two years. by randomizing link destinations in blogspace, but retaining sources and timestamps, we introduce a concept of randomized blogspace . herein, we observe similar evolution of a giant component, but no corresponding increase in community structure. having demonstrated the formation of micro-communities over time, we then turn to the ongoing activity within active communities. we extend recent work of kleinberg  to discover dense periods of "bursty" intra-community link creation.

citee title:a probabilistic model for retrospective news event detection
citee abstract:retrospective news event detection (red) is defined as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news corpus. although both the contents and time information of news articles are helpful to red, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news articles. few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. in this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news articles. on the one hand, news articles are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. the former hints a generative model of news articles, and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform red. with consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. this model gives new representations of both news articles and news events. furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive red system, hiscovery, which provides additional functions to present events, photo story and chronicle.

citee title:opinion observer: analyzing and comparing opinions on the web
citee abstract:the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. it makes two contributions. first, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented. the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. for a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. for a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews. such features form the basis for the above comparison. experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.

citee abstract:mining subtopics from weblogs and analyzing their spatiotemporal patterns have applications in multiple domains. in this paper, we define the novel problem of mining spatiotemporal theme patterns from weblogs and propose a novel probabilistic approach to model the subtopic themes and spatiotemporal theme patterns simultaneously. the proposed model discovers spatiotemporal theme patterns by (1) extracting common themes from weblogs; (2) generating theme life cycles for each given location; and (3) generating theme snapshots for each given time period. evolution of patterns can be discovered by comparative analysis of theme life cycles and theme snapshots. experiments on three different data sets show that the proposed approach can discover interesting spatiotemporal theme patterns effectively. the proposed probabilistic model is general and can be used for spatiotemporal text mining on any domain with time and location information.

citee abstract:probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena. the central objects of probability theory are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical ions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion. although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is a random event, if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted. two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.  as a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data. methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics. a great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.

citee abstract:bayesian methods are given for finite-category sampling when some of the observations suffer missing category distinctions. dickey's (1983) generalization of the dirichlet family of prior distributions is found to be closed under such censored sampling. the posterior moments and predictive probabilities are proportional to ratios of b. c. carlson's multiple hypergeometric functions. closed-form expressions are developed for the case of nested reported sets, when bayesian estimates can be computed easily from relative frequencies. effective computational methods are also given in the general case. an example involving surveys of death-penalty attitudes is used throughout to illustrate the theory. a simple special case of categorical missing data is a two-way contingency table with cross-classified count data xsubij/sub (i = 1,..., r; j = 1,..., c), together with supplementary trials counted only in the margin distinguishing the rows, ysubi/sub(i = 1,..., r). there could also be further supplementary trials reported only by counts distinguishing the columns, zsubj/sub(j = 1,..., c). under assumptions that the censoring process itself is "noninformative" regarding the category probabilities θsubij/sub (e.g., the report for each possible outcome might be nonrandom and prespecified), the bayesian inference regarding the θsubij/sub's would be based on the likelihood function. (Πsubij/sub thetasupxsubij/sub/supsubij/sub)  . such a likelihood is ordinarily considered intractable and unsuited for bayesian conjugate prior inference. we develop a bayesian conjugate theory, however, by recognizing the complete integrals of such functions as carlson functions and the posterior distributions resulting from dirichlet prior distributions as known generalized dirichlet distributions. the corresponding posterior density functions are similar in form to the likelihood, and these constitute a family of distributions closed under sampling and tractable in various senses, including the convenient computability of moments and modes.

citee title:an argumentation analysis of weblog conversations
citee abstract:weblogs are important new components of the internet. they provide individual users with an easy way to publish online and others to comment on these views. furthermore, there is a suite of secondary applications that allow weblogs to be linked, searched, and navigated. although originally intended for individual use, in practice weblogs increasingly appear to facilitate distributed conversations. this could have important implications for the use of this technology as a medium for collaboration. given the special characteristics of weblogs and their supporting applications, they may be well suited for a range of conversational purposes that require different forms of argumentation. in this paper, we analyze the argumentation potential of weblog technologies, using a diagnostic framework for argumentation technologies. we pay special attention to the conversation structures and dynamics that weblogs naturally afford. based on this initial analysis, we make a number of recommendations for research on how to apply these technologies in purposeful conversation processes such as for knowledge management.

citee title:bridging the gap: a genre analysis of weblogs
citee abstract:weblogs (blogs)—frequently modified web pages in which dated entries are listed in reverse chronological sequence—are the latest genre of internet communication to attain widespread popularity, yet their characteristics have not been systematically described. this paper presents the results of a content analysis of 203 randomly-selected weblogs, comparing the empirically observable features of the corpus with popular claims about the nature of weblogs, and finding them to differ in a number of respects. notably, blog authors, journalists and scholars alike exaggerate the extent to which blogs are interlinked, interactive, and oriented towards external events, and underestimate the importance of blogs as individualistic, intimate forms of self-expression. based on the profile generated by the empirical analysis, we consider the likely antecedents of the blog genre, situate it with respect to the dominant forms of digital communication on the internet today, and advance predictions about its long-term impacts.

citee abstract:in many applications, users specify target values for certain attributes, without requiring exact matches to these values in return. instead, the result to such queries is typically a rank of the "top k" tuples that best match the given attribute values. in this paper, we study the advantages and limitations of processing a top-k query by translating it into a single range query that a traditional relational database management system (rdbms) can process efficiently. in particular, we study how to determine a range query to evaluate a top-k query by exploiting the statistics available to an rdbms, and the impact of the quality of these statistics on the retrieval efficiency of the resulting scheme. we also report the first experimental evaluation of the mapping strategies over a real rdbms, namely over microsoft's sql server 7.0. the experiments show that our new techniques are robust and significantly more efficient than previously known strategies requiring at least one sequential scan of the data sets.

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or “top?k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the user’s location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.
surrounding text:a major concern of this paper is the query processing techniques for supporting ranking.  several techniques have been previously developed in database research for the top-k problem [6, ***, 14, 15, 31]<1>.  we adopt the algorithm in [15]<1> for our purposes, and discuss issues such as how the relational engine and indexes/materialized views can be leveraged for query performance. however, we observe that the overlap similarity function (in fact, all similarity functions discussed in this paper) satisfies a useful monotonic property: if t and u are two tuples such that for all k, sk(tk, qk) fi sk(uk, qk), then sim(t, q) fi sim(u, q).  this enables us to adapt fagin’s threshold algorithm (ta) and its derivatives [***, 15]<1> to retrieve the top-k tuples without having to process all tuples of the database.  to adapt ta for our purposes, we have to implement two types of access methods: (a) sorted access along any attribute ak, in which tids of tuples can be efficiently retrieved one-by-one in order of decreasing similarity of their ak attribute value from qk, and (b) random access, in which the entire tuple corresponding to any given tid can be efficiently retrieved. we leverage available database indexes such as b+ trees to efficiently implement these two access methods.  since it is unrealistic to assume that indexes are always present on all attributes specified by any query, we adapt a derivative of ta [***]<1> that works even if sorted access is not available on some attributes.  our resulting adaptation, called the index-based threshold algorithm, or ita, is shown in figure 2

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (‘‘fagin’s algorithm’? or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (‘‘the threshold algorithm’? or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee title:a probabilistic framework for vague queries and imprecise information in databases
citee abstract:a probabilistic learning model for vague queries and missing or imprecise information in databases is described. instead of retrieving only a set of answers, our approach yields a ranking of objects from the database in response to a query. by using relevance judgements from the user about the objects retrieved, the ranking for the actual query as well as the overall retrieval quality of the system can be further improved. for specifying different kinds of conditions in vague queries, the notion of vague predicates is introduced. based on the underlying probabilistic model, also imprecise or missing attribute values can be treated easily. in addition, the corresponding formulas can be applied in combination with standard predicates (from two-valued logic), thus extending standard database systems for coping with missing or imprecise data.

citee title:vague: a user interface to relational databases that permits vague queries
citee abstract:a specific query establishes a rigid qualification and is concerned only with data that match it precisely. a vague query establishes a target qualification and is concerned also with data that are close to this target. most conventional database systems cannot handle vague queries directly, forcing their users to retry specific queries repeatedly with minor modifications until they match data that are satisfactory. this article describes a system called vague that can handle vague queries directly. the principal concept behind vague is its extension to the relational data model with data metrics, which are definitions of distances between values of the same domain. a problem with implementing data distances is that different users may have different interpretations for the notion of distance. vague incorporates several features that enable it to adapt itself to the individual views and priorities of its users.

citee abstract:the goal of data analysis in aviation safety is simple: improve safety. however, the path to this goal is hard to identify. what data mining methods are most applicable to this task? what data are available and how should they be analyzed? how do we focus on the most interesting results? our answers to these questions are based on a recent research project we completed. the encouraging news is that we found a number of aviation safety offices doing commendable work to collect and analyze safety-related data. but we also found a number of areas where data mining techniques could provide new tools that either perform analyses that were not considered before, or that can now be done more easily.  currently, aviation safety offices collect and analyze the incident reports by a combination of manual and automated methods. data analysis is done by safety officers who are well familiar with the domain, but not with data mining methods. some aviation safety officers have tools to automate the database query and report generation process. however, the actual analysis is done by the officer with only fairly rudimentary tools to help extract the useful information from the data.  our research project looked at the application of data mining techniques to aviation safety data to help aviation safety officers with their analysis task. this effort led to the creation of a tool called the “aviation safety data mining workbench? this paper describes the research effort, the workbench, the experience with data mining of aviation safety data, and lessons learned.

citee abstract:the problem of computing a small vertex separator in a graph arises in the context of computing a good ordering for the parallel factorization of sparse, symmetric matrices. an algebraic approach to computing vertex separators is considered in this paper. it is shown that lower bounds on separator sizes can be obtained in terms of the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix associated with a graph. the laplacian eigenvectors of grid graphs can be computed from kronecker products involving the eigenvectors of path graphs, and these eigenvectors can be used to compute good separators in grid graphs. a heuristic algorithm is designed to compute a vertex separator in a general graph by first computing an edge separator in the graph from an eigenvector of the laplaeian matrix, and then using a maximum matching in a subgraph to compute the vertex separator. results on the quality of the separators computed by the spectral algorithm are presented, and these are compared with separators obtained from automatic nested dissection and the kernighan-lin algorithm. finally, we report the time required to compute the laplacian eigenvector, and consider the accuracy with which the eigenvector must be computed to obtain good separators. the spectral algorithm has'the advantage that it can be implemented on a medium size multiprocessor in a straight forward manner.

citee title:a language modeling approach to information retrieval
citee abstract:models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied. the integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. we argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. this suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. however, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. we estimate models for each document individually. our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. one advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. we have implemented our model and tested it empirically. our approach significantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two different collections and query sets.

citee abstract:the smart information retrieval project emphasizes completely automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large quantities of text. we continue our work in trec 3, performing runs in the routing, ad-hoc, and foreign language environments. our major focus is massive query expansion: adding from 300 to 530 terms to each query. these terms come from known relevant documents in the case of routing, and from just the top retrieved documents in the case of ad-hoc and spanish.

citee title:compressed data cubes for olap aggregate query approximation on continuous dimensions
citee abstract:efficiently answering decision support queries is an importantproblem. most of the work in this direction has been in the contextof the data cube. queries are efficiently answered by pre-computinglarge parts of the cube. besides having large space requirements,such pre-computation requires that the hierarchy along eachdimension be fixed (hence dimensions are categorical or pre-discretized). queries that take advantage of pre-computation canthus only drill-down or roll-up along this fixed hierarchy. anotherdisadvantage of existing pre-computation techniques is that thetarget measure, along with the aggregation function of interest, isfixed for each cube. queries over more than one target measure orusing different aggregation functions, would require pre-computinglarger data cubes. in this paper, we propose a new compressedrepresentation of the data cube that (a) drastically reduces storagerequirements, (b) does not require the discretization hierarchy alongeach query dimension to be fixed beforehand and (c) treats eachdimension as a potential target measure and supports multipleaggregation functions without additional storage costs. the tradeoffis approximate, yet relatively accurate, answers to queries. weoutline mechanisms to reduce the error in the approximation. ourperformance evaluation indicates that our compression techniqueeffectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches.

citee title:a condensation approach to privacy preserving data mining
citee abstract:in recent years, privacy preserving data mining has become an important problem because of the large amount of personal data which is tracked by many business applications. in many cases, users are unwilling to provide personal information unless the privacy of sensitive information is guaranteed. in this paper, we propose a new framework for privacy preserving data mining of multi-dimensional data. previous work for privacy preserving data mining uses a perturbation approach which reconstructs data distributions in order to perform the mining. such an approach treats each dimension independently and therefore ignores the correlations between the di erent dimensions. in addition, it requires the development of a new distribution based algorithm for each data mining problem, since it does not use the multi-dimensional records, but uses aggregate distributions of the data as input. this leads to a fundamental re-design of data mining algorithms. in this paper, we will develop a new and  exible approach for privacy preserving data mining which does not require new problem-specific algorithms, since it maps the original data set into a new anonymized data set. this anonymized data closely matches the characteristics of the original data including the correlations among the di erent dimensions. we present empirical results illustrating the e ectiveness of the method

citee title:approximation algorithms for k-anonymity
citee abstract:we consider the problem of releasing a table containing personal records, while ensuring individual privacy and maintaining data integrity to the extent possible. one of the techniques proposed in the literature is k-anonymization. a release is considered k-anonymous if the information corresponding to any individual in the release cannot be distinguished from that of at least k ? 1 other individuals whose information also appears in the release. in order to achieve k-anonymization, some of the entries of the table are either suppressed or generalized (e.g. an age value of 23 could be changed to the age range 20-25). the goal is to lose as little information as possible while ensuring that the release is k-anonymous. this optimization problem is referred to as the k-anonymity problem. we show that the k-anonymity problem is np-hard even when the attribute values are ternary and we are allowed only to suppress entries. on the positive side, we provide an o(k)-approximation algorithm for the problem. we also give improved positive results for the interesting cases with specific values of k ?in particular, we give a 1.5-approximation algorithm for the special case of 2-anonymity, and a 2-approximation algorithm for 3-anonymity.

citee title:max-min d-cluster formation in wireless ad hoc networks
citee abstract:an ad hoc network may be logically represented as a set of clusters. the clusterheads form a d-hop dominating set. each node is at most d hops from a clusterhead. clusterheads form a virtual backbone and may be used to route packets for nodes in their cluster. previous heuristics restricted themselves to 1-hop clusters. we show that the minimum d-hop dominating set problem is np-complete. then we present a heuristic to form d-clusters in a wireless ad hoc network. nodes are assumed to have non-deterministic mobility pattern. clusters are formed by diffusing node identities along the wireless links. when the heuristic terminates, a node either becomes a clusterhead, or is at most d wireless hops away from its clusterhead. the value of d is a parameter of the heuristic. the heuristic can be run either at regular intervals, or whenever the network configuration changes. one of the features of the heuristic is that it tends to re-elect existing clusterheads even when the network configuration changes. this helps to reduce the communication overheads during transition from old clusterheads to new clusterheads. also, there is a tendency to evenly distribute the mobile nodes among the clusterheads, and evently distribute the responsibility of acting as clusterheads among all nodes. thus, the heuristic is fair and stable. simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is better than the two earlier heuristics, namely the lca  and degree based  solutions

citee title:an energy-efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks
citee abstract:a wireless network consisting of a large number of small sensors with low-power transceivers can be an effective tool for gathering data in a variety of environments. the data collected by each sensor is communicated through the network to a single processing center that uses all reported data to determine characteristics of the environment or detect an event. the communication or message passing process must be designed to conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the clusterheads communicate the aggregated information to the processing center, may save energy. in this paper, we propose a distributed, randomized clustering algorithm to organize the sensors in a wireless sensor network into clusters. we then extend this algorithm to generate a hierarchy of clusterheads and observe that the energy savings increase with the number of levels in the hierarchy. results in stochastic geometry are used to derive solutions for the values of parameters of our algorithm that minimize the total energy spent in the network when all sensors report data through the clusterheads to the processing center.

citee title:scalable clustering algorithms with balancing constraints
citee abstract:clustering methods for data-mining problems must be extremely scalable. in addition, several data mining applications demand that the clusters obtained be balanced, i.e., of approximately the same size or importance. in this paper, we propose a general framework for scalable, balanced clustering. the data clustering process is broken down into three steps: sampling of a small representative subset of the points, clustering of the sampled data, and populating the initial clusters with the remaining data followed by refinements. first, we show that a simple uniform sampling from the original data is sufficient to get a representative subset with high probability. while the proposed framework allows a large class of algorithms to be used for clustering the sampled set, we focus on some popular parametric algorithms for ease of exposition. we then present algorithms to populate and refine the clusters. the algorithm for populating the clusters is based on a generalization of the stable marriage problem, whereas the refinement algorithm is a constrained iterative relocation scheme. the complexity of the overall method is o(kn log n) for obtaining k balanced clusters from n data points, which compares favorably with other existing techniques for balanced clustering. in addition to providing balancing guarantees, the clustering performance obtained using the proposed framework is comparable to and often better than the corresponding unconstrained solution. experimental results on several datasets, including high-dimensional (>20,000) ones, are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

citee title:the complexity of non-hierarchical clustering with constraints
citee abstract:recent work has looked at extending clustering algorithms with instance level must-link (ml) and cannot-link (cl) background information. our work introduces ? and ? cluster level constraints that influence inter-cluster distances and cluster composition. the addition of background information, though useful at providing better clustering results, raises the important feasibility question: given a collection of constraints and a set of data, does there exist at least one partition of the data set satisfying all the constraints? we study the complexity of the feasibility problem for each of the above constraints separately and also for combinations of constraints. our results clearly delineate combinations of constraints for which the feasibility problem is computationally intractable (i.e., np-complete) from those for which the problem is efficiently solvable (i.e., in the computational class p). we also consider the ml and cl constraints in conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms (cnf and dnf respectively). we show that for ml constraints, the feasibility problem is intractable for cnf but efficiently solvable for dnf. unfortunately, for cl constraints, the feasibility problem is intractable for both cnf and dnf. this effectively means that cl-constraints in a non-trivial form cannot be efficiently incorporated into clustering algorithms. to overcome this, we introduce the notion of a choice-set of constraints and prove that the feasibility problem for choice-sets is efficiently solvable for both ml and cl constraints. we also present empirical results which indicate that the feasibility problem occurs extensively in real world problems.

citee title:practical data-oriented microaggregation for statistical disclosure control
citee abstract:microaggregation is a statistical disclosure control technique for microdata disseminated in statistical databases. raw microdata (i.e., individual records or data vectors) are grouped into small aggregates prior to publication. each aggregate should contain at least k data vectors to prevent disclosure of individual information, where k is a constant value preset by the data protector. no exact polynomial algorithms are known to date to microaggregate optimally, i.e., with minimal variability loss. methods in the literature rank data and partition them into groups of fixed-size; in the multivariate case, ranking is performed by projecting data vectors onto a single axis. in this paper, candidate optimal solutions to the multivariate and univariate microaggregation problems are characterized. in the univariate case, two heuristics based on hierarchical clustering and genetic algorithms are introduced which are data-oriented in that they try to preserve natural data aggregates. in the multivariate case, fixed-size and hierarchical clustering microaggregation algorithms are presented which do not require data to be projected onto a single dimension; such methods clearly reduce variability loss as compared to conventional multivariate microaggregation on projected data

citee title:a microeconomic data mining problem: customer-oriented catalog segmentation
citee abstract:the microeconomic framework for data mining  assumes that an enterprise chooses a decision maximizing the overall utility over all customers where the contribution of a customer is a function of the data available on that customer. in catalog segmentation, the enterprise wants to design k product catalogs of size r that maximize the overall number of catalog products purchased. however, there are many applications where a customer, once attracted to an enterprise, would purchase more products beyond the ones contained in the catalog. therefore, in this paper, we investigate an alternative problem formulation, that we call customer-oriented catalog segmentation, where the overall utility is measured by the number of customers that have at least a specified minimum interest t in the catalogs. we formally introduce the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem and discuss its complexity. then we investigate two different paradigms to design efficient, approximate algorithms for the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem, greedy (deterministic) and randomized algorithms. since greedy algorithms may be trapped in a local optimum and randomized algorithms crucially depend on a reasonable initial solution, we explore a combination of these two paradigms. our experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates that the new algorithms yield catalogs of significantly higher utility compared to classical catalog segmentation algorithms

citee abstract:data summarization has been recognized as a fundamental operation in database systems and data mining with important applications such as data compression and privacy preservation. while the existing methods such as cfvalues and databubbles may perform reasonably well, they cannot provide any guarantees on the quality of their results. in this paper, we introduce a summarization approach for numerical data based on discs formalizing the notion of quality. our objective is to find a minimal set of discs, i.e. spheres satisfying a radius and a significance constraint, covering the given dataset. since the proposed problem is np-complete, we design two different approximation algorithms. these algorithms have a quality guarantee, but they do not scale well to large databases. however, the machinery from approximation algorithms allows a precise characterization of a further, heuristic algorithm. this heuristic, efficient algorithm exploits multi-dimensional index structures and can be well-integrated with database systems. the experiments show that our heuristic algorithm generates summaries that outperform the state-of-the-art data bubbles in terms of internal measures as well as in terms of external measures when using the data summaries as input for clustering methods.

citee title:optimal energy aware clustering in sensor network
citee abstract:sensor networks is among the fastest growing technologies that have the potential of changing our lives drastically. these collaborative, dynamic and distributed computing and communicating systems will be self organizing. they will have capabilities of distributing a task among themselves for efficient computation. there are many challenges in implementation of such systems: energy dissipation and clustering being one of them. in order to maintain a certain degree of service quality and a reasonable system lifetime, energy needs to be optimized at every stage of system operation. sensor node clustering is another very important optimization problem. nodes that are clustered together will easily be able to communicate with each other. considering energy as an optimization parameter while clustering is imperative. in this paper we study the theoretical aspects of the clustering problem in sensor networks with application to energy optimization. we illustrate an optimal algorithm for clustering the sensor nodes such that each cluster (which has a master) is balanced and the total distance between sensor nodes and master nodes is minimized. balancing the clusters is needed for evenly distributing the load on all master nodes. minimizing the total distance helps in reducing the communication overhead and hence the energy dissipation. this problem (which we call balanced k-clustering) is modeled as a mincost flow problem which can be solved optimally using existing techniques.

citee title:clustering and visualization of retail market baskets
citee abstract:transaction analysis, including clustering of market baskets, is a key application of data mining to the retail industry. this domain has some specific requirements, such as the need for obtaining easily interpretable and actionable results. it also exhibits some very challenging characteristics, mostly stemming from the fact that the data have thousands of features and are highly non-gaussian and sparse. this chapter proposes a relationship-based approach to clustering such data that tries to sidestep the “curse-of-dimensionality?issue by working in a suitable similarity space instead of the original high-dimensional feature space. this intermediary similarity space can be suitably tailored to satisfy business criteria such as requiring customer clusters to represent comparable amounts of revenue. we apply efficient and scalable graph-partitioning-based clustering techniques in this space. the output from the clustering algorithm is used to reorder the data points so that the resulting permuted similarity matrix can be readily visualized in two dimensions, with clusters showing up as bands. the visualization is very helpful for assessing and improving clustering. for example, actionable recommendations for splitting or merging clusters can be easily derived, and it also guides the user toward a suitable number of clusters. results are presented on a real retail industry data set of several thousand customers and products

citee title:joint optimization of customer segmentation and marketing policy to maximize long-term profitability
citee abstract:with the advent of one-to-one marketing media, e.g. targeted direct mail or internet marketing, the opportunities to develop targeted marketing campaigns are enhanced in such a way that it is now both organizationally and economically feasible to profitably support a substantially larger number of marketing segments. however, the problem of what segments to distinguish, and what actions to take towards the different segments increases substantially in such an environment. a systematic analytic procedure optimizing both steps would be very welcome.in this study, we present a joint optimization approach addressing two issues: (1) the segmentation of customers into homogeneous groups of customers, (2) determining the optimal policy (i.e., what action to take from a set of available actions) towards each segment. we implement this joint optimization framework in a direct-mail setting for a charitable organization. many previous studies in this area highlighted the importance of the following variables: r(ecency), f(requency), and m(onetary value). we use these variables to segment customers. in a second step, we determine which marketing policy is optimal using markov decision processes, following similar previous applications. the attractiveness of this stochastic dynamic programming procedure is based on the long-run maximization of expected average profit. our contribution lies in the combination of both steps into one optimization framework to obtain an optimal allocation of marketing expenditures. moreover, we control segment stability and policy performance by a bootstrap procedure. our framework is illustrated by a real-life application. the results show that the proposed model outperforms a chaid segmentation.

citee abstract:the challenge of privacy-preserving data mining lies in respecting privacy requirements while discovering the original interesting patterns or structures. existing methods loose the correlations among attributes by transforming the different attributes independently, or cannot guarantee the minimum ion level required by legal policies. in this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving transformation framework for distance-based mining operations based on the concept of privacy-preserving microclusters that satisfy a privacy constraint as well as a significance constraint. our framework well extends the robustness of the state-of-the-art k-anonymity model by introducing a privacy constraint (minimum radius) while keeping its effectiveness by a significance constraint (minimum number of corresponding data records). the privacy-preserving microclusters are made public for data mining purposes, but the original data records are kept private. we present efficient methods for generating and maintaining privacy-preserving microclusters and show that data mining operations such as clustering can easily be adapted to the public data represented by microclusters instead of the private data records. the experiment demonstrates that the proposed methods achieve accurate clusterings results while preserving the privacy.

citee title:generalizing data to provide anonymity when disclosing information
citee abstract:the proliferation of information on the internet and access to fast computers with large storage capacities has increased the volume of information collected and disseminated about individuals. the existence of these data sources makes it much easier to re-identify individuals whose private information is released in data believed to be anonymous. at the same time, increasing demands are made on organizations to release individualized data rather than aggregate statistical information. even when explicit identifiers, such as name and phone number, are removed or encrypted when releasing individualized data, other characteristic data, which we term quasi-identifiers, can exist which allow the data recipient to re-identify individuals to whom the data refer.  in this paper, we provide a computational disclosure technique for releasing information from a private table such that the identity of any individual to whom the released data refer cannot be definitively recognized. our approach protects against linking to other data. it is based on the concepts of generalization, by which stored values can be replaced with semantically consistent but less precise alternatives, and of k-anonymity. a table is said to provide k-anonymity when the contained data do not allow the recipient to associate the released information with a set of individuals smaller than k. we introduce the notions of generalized table and of minimal generalization of a table with respect to a k-anonymity requirement. as an optimization problem, the objective is to minimally distort the data while providing adequate protection. we describe an algorithm that, given a table, efficiently computes a preferred minimal generalization to provide anonymity.

surrounding text:thus, the heuristic is fair and stable.  simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is better than the two earlier heuristics, namely the lca [***]<2> and degree based [11]<2> solutions</abstract>.  i. introduction ad hoc networks (also referred to as packet radio networks) consist of nodes that move freely and communicate with other nodes via wireless links.  one way to support efficient communication between nodes is to develop a wireless backbone architecture [***]<2>, [2]<2>, [4]<2>, [8]<2>.  while all nodes are identical in their capabilities, certain nodes are elected to form the backbone. due to the mobility of nodes in an ad hoc network, the backbone must be continuously reconstructed in a timely fashion, as the nodes move away from their associated clusterheads.  the election of clusterheads has been a topic of many papers as described in [***]<2>, [2]<2>, [8]<2>.  in all of these papers the leader election guarantees that no node will be more than one hop away from a leader. additionally, the heuristic elects clusterheads in such a manner as to favor their re-election in future rounds, thereby reducing transition overheads when old clusterheads give way to new clusterheads, however, it is also fair as a large number of nodes equally share the responsibility for acting as clusterheads.  furthermore, this heuristic has time complexity of o(d) rounds which compares favorably to o(n) for earlier heuristics [***]<2>, [4]<2> for large mobile networks.  this reduction in time complexity is obtained by increasing the concurrency in communication. typically, backbones are constructed to connect neighborhoods in the network.  past solutions of this kind have created a hierarchy where every node in the network was no more than 1 hop away from a clusterhead [***]<2>, [4]<2>, [10]<2>.  in large networks this approach may generate a large number of clusterheads and eventually lead to the same problem as stated in the first design approach. furthermore, some of the previous clustering solutions have relied on synchronous clocks for exchange of data between nodes.  in the linked cluster algorithm [***]<2>, lca, nodes communicate using tdma frames.  each frame has a slot for each node in the network to communicate, avoiding collisions. therefore, a node must realize not only if it is the largest in its d-neighborhood but also if it is the largest in any other node’s d-neighborhood.  this is similar to the strategy employed in [***]<2>.  the second stage uses d rounds of floodmin to propagate the smaller node ids that have not been overtaken. thus, the storage complexity is o(d).  this compares favorably with heuristics like [***]<2>, [2]<2> where identities of all neighboring nodes is maintained and the storage complexity is o(n).  viii. viii.  simulation experiments and results we conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic and compare these finding against three heuristics, the original linked cluster algorithm (lca) [***]<2>, the revised linked cluster algorithm (lca2) [5]<2>, and the highest-connectivity (degree) [11]<2>, [8]<2> heuristic.  we assumed a variety of systems running with 100, 200, 400, and 600 nodes to simulate ad hoc networks with varying levels of node density

citee title:routing in ad-hoc networks using minimum connected dominating sets
citee abstract:we impose a virtual backbone structure on the ad-hoc network, in order to support unicast, multicast, and fault-tolerant routing within the ad-hoc network. this virtual backbone differs from the wired backbone of cellular networks in two key ways: (a) it may change as nodes move, and (b) it is not used primarily for routing packets or flows, but only for computing and updating routes. the primary routes for packets and flows are still computed by a shortest-paths computation; the virtual backbone can, if necessary provide backup routes to handle interim failures. because of the dynamic nature of the virtual backbone, our approach splits the routing problem into two levels: (a) find and update the virtual backbone, and (b) then find and update routes. the key contribution of this paper is to describe several alternatives for the first part of finding and updating the virtual backbone. to keep the virtual backbone as small as possible we use an approximation to the minimum connected dominating set (mcds) of the ad-hoc network topology as the virtual backbone. the hosts in the mcds maintain local copies of the global topology of the network, along with shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
surrounding text:introduction ad hoc networks (also referred to as packet radio networks) consist of nodes that move freely and communicate with other nodes via wireless links.  one way to support efficient communication between nodes is to develop a wireless backbone architecture [1]<2>, [2]<2>, [***]<2>, [8]<2>.  while all nodes are identical in their capabilities, certain nodes are elected to form the backbone. additionally, the heuristic elects clusterheads in such a manner as to favor their re-election in future rounds, thereby reducing transition overheads when old clusterheads give way to new clusterheads, however, it is also fair as a large number of nodes equally share the responsibility for acting as clusterheads.  furthermore, this heuristic has time complexity of o(d) rounds which compares favorably to o(n) for earlier heuristics [1]<2>, [***]<2> for large mobile networks.  this reduction in time complexity is obtained by increasing the concurrency in communication. typically, backbones are constructed to connect neighborhoods in the network.  past solutions of this kind have created a hierarchy where every node in the network was no more than 1 hop away from a clusterhead [1]<2>, [***]<2>, [10]<2>.  in large networks this approach may generate a large number of clusterheads and eventually lead to the same problem as stated in the first design approach

citee title:model-based gaussian and non-gaussian clustering
citee abstract:the classification maximum likelihood approach is sufficiently general to encompass many current clustering algorithms, including those based on the sum of squares criterion and on the criterion of friedman and rubin (1967). however, as currently implemented, it does not allow the specification of which features (orientation, size and shape) are to be common to all clusters and which may differ between clusters. also, it is restricted to gaussian distributions and it does not allow for noise. we propose ways of overcoming these limitations. a reparameterization of the covariance matrix allows us to specify that some features, but not all, be the same for all clusters. a practical framework for non-gaussian clustering is outlined, and a means of incorporating noise in the form of a poisson process is described. an approximate bayesian method for choosing the number of clusters is given. the performance of the proposed methods is studied by simulation, with encouraging results. the methods are applied to the analysis of a data set arising in the study of diabetes, and the results seem better than those of previous analyses. keywords include: bayes factors; classification; diabetes; hierarchical agglomeration; iterative relocation; mixture models

citee title:cure: an efficient clustering algorithm for large databases
citee abstract:clustering, in data mining, is useful for discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions in the underlying data. traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very frag- ile in the presence of outliers. we propose a new cluster- ing algorithm called cure that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. cure achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are gen- erated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. having more than one representa- tive point per cluster allows cure to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. to handle large databases, cure employs a combination of random sampling and par- titioning. a random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is partially clustered. the partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by cure is much better than those found by existing algorithms. furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling and partitioning enable cure to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing cluster- ing quality.

(for k-means we used a “standard?k-means algorithm and a variant of k-means, “bisecting?k-means.) hierarchicalclustering is often portrayed as the better quality clustering approach, but is limited because of its quadratic time complexity. in contrast, k-means and its variants have a time complexity which is linear in the number of documents, but are thought to produce inferior clusters. sometimes k-means and agglomerative hierarchical approaches are combined so as to “get the best of both worlds.?however, our results indicate that the bisecting k-means technique is better than thestandard k-means approach and as good or better than the hierarchical approaches that we tested for a variety of cluster evaluation metrics. we propose an explanation for these results that is based on an analysis of the specifics of the clustering algorithms and the nature of document .data

citee title:cluster ensembles ?a knowledge reuse framework for combining partitions
citee abstract:this paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. we first identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. the cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. in addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three eective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). the first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. the second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. the third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. we evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively dierent application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.

citee title:a model for reasoning about persistence and causation
citee abstract:reasoning about change requires predicting how long a proposition, having become true, will continue to be so. lacking perfect knowledge, an agent may be constrained to believe that a proposition persists indefinitely simply because there is no way for the agent to infer a contravening proposition with certainty. in this paper, we describe a model of causal reasoning that accounts for knowledge concerning cause-and-effect relationships and knowledge concerning the tendency for propositions to persist or not as a function of time passing. our model has a natural encoding in the form of a network representation for probabilistic models. we consider the computational properties of our model by reviewing recent advances in computing the consequences of models encoded in this network representation. finally, we discuss how our probabilistic model addresses certain classical problems in temporal reasoning (e. g., the frame and qualification problems).
surrounding text:with such a representation we can be explicit about the direct dependencies which are present and use the independencies to our advantage computationally, however, bayesian networks are designed to reason about static processes, and cannot be used directly to answer the types of questions that concern us here.  dynamic bayesian networks (dbns) (dean & kanazawa, 1989)[***]<1> are the standard extension of bayesian networks to temporal processes.  dbns model a dynamic system by discretizing time and providing a bayesian network fragment that represents the probabilistic transition of the state at time t to the state at time t +1

citee title:probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems
citee abstract:probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems is a complete andaccessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. the author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other ai approaches to uncertainty, such as the dempster-shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. the author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty—and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition—in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in ai, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. the book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in ai, operations research, or applied probability.

citee title:an introduction to variational methods for graphical models
citee abstract:this paper presents a tutorial introduction to the use of variational methods for inference and learningin graphical models (bayesian networks and markov random fields). we present a number of examples of graphicalmodels, including the qmr-dt database, the sigmoid belief network, the boltzmann machine, and several variantsof hidden markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. we then introduce variationalmethods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphicalmodel in which inference is efficient. inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interestin the original model. we describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convexduality. finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in eachcase.

citee abstract:winbugs is a fully extensible modular framework for constructing and analysing bayesian full probability models. models may be specified either textually via the bugs language or pictorially using a graphical interface called doodlebugs. winbugs processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. the software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using markov chain monte carlo techniques. in this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. we also discuss how the framework may be extended. it is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with winbugs for users with specialized requirements. it is also possible to interface with winbugs at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by winbugs without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the winbugs source-code

citee abstract:one of the central issues in the use of princi-pal component analysis (pca) for data mod-elling is that of choosing the appropriate num-ber of retained components. this problem wasrecently addressed through the formulation of abayesian treatment of pca (bishop, 1999a) interms of a probabilistic latent variable model. acentral feature of this approach is that the effec-tive dimensionality of the latent space (equiv-alent to the number of retained principal com-ponents) is determined automatically as partof the bayesian inference procedure. in com-mon with most non-trivial bayesian models,however, the required marginalizations are an-alytically intractable, and so an approximationscheme based on a local gaussian representa-tion of the posterior distribution was employed.in this paper we develop an alternative, varia-tional formulation of bayesian pca, based ona factorial representation of the posterior distri-bution. this approach is computationally effi-cient, and unlike other approximation schemes,it maximizes a rigorous lower bound on themarginal log probability of the observed data.

citee abstract:theoretical considerations and psycholinguistic studies have alternately provided criticism and support for the proposal that semantic and grammatical functions are distinct subprocesses within the language domain. neurobiological evidence concerning this hypothesis was sought by (1) comparing, in normal adults, event-related brain potentials (erps) elicited by words that provide primarily semantic information (open class) and grammatical information (closed class) and (2) comparing the effects of the altered early language experience of congenitally deaf subjects on erps to open and closed class words. in normal-hearing adults, the different word types elicited qualitatively different erps that were compatible with the hypothesized different roles of the word classes in language processing. in addition, whereas erp indices of semantic processing were virtually identical in deaf and hearing subjects, those linked to grammatical processes were markedly different in deaf and bearing subjects. the results suggest that nonidentical neural systems with different developmental vulnerabilities mediate these different aspects of language. more generally, these results provide neurobiological support for the distinction between semantic and grammatical functions.

surrounding text:so, how might a language learner discover the syntactic and semantic classes of words.  cognitive scientists have shown that unsupervised statistical methods can be used to identify syntactic classes [***]<2> and to extract a representation of semantic content [4]<2>, but none of these methods captures the interaction between function and content words, or even recognizes that these roles are distinct.  here we explore how statistical learning, with no prior knowledge of either syntax or semantics, can discover the difference between function and content words and simultaneously organize words into syntactic classes and semantic topics. this simplifies the problem, as most words belong to a single class.  however, genuinely unsupervised recovery of parts-of-speech has been used to assess statistical models of language learning, such as distributional clustering [***]<2>.  we assessed tagging performance on the brown corpus, using two tagsets. this is partly because all words that vary strongly in frequency across contexts get assigned to the semantic class in the composite model, so it misses some of the fine-grained distinctions expressed in the full tagset.  both the hmm and the composite model performed better than the distributional clustering method described in [***]<2>, which was used to form the 1000 most frequent words in brown into 19 clusters.  figure 6 compares this clustering with the classes for those words from the hmm and composite models trained on brown

citee abstract:how do people know as much as they do with as little information as they get? the problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. a new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (lsa), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. by inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, lsa acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of english at a comparable rate to school-children. lsa uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched.

citee title:unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis
citee abstract:this paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data whichis closely related to a technique known as latent semantic analysis. in contrast to the latter method whichstems from linear algebra and performs a singular value decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposedtechnique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. this resultsin a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. more precisely, we propose tomake use of a temperature controlled version of the expectation maximization algorithm for model fitting, whichhas shown excellent performance in practice. probabilistic latent semantic analysis has many applications, mostprominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas.the paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses anapplication in automated document indexing. the experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvementsof the probabilistic method over standard latent semantic analysis.

citee title:automated image retrieval using color and texture
citee abstract:the growing prevalence of digital images and videos is increasing the need for filters based on visual content. unfortunately, the appearance of effective tools for searching for and retrieving images and videos from large archives has not accompanied the proliferation of images and videos in digital form. in addition to the text-based indexes built upon human supplied annotations, digital image and video libraries require new algorithms for the automated extraction and indexing of relevant image features. in this paper we investigate a system for automated content extraction and database searching based upon color and texture features. these features are important because colors and textures are fundamental characteristics of the content of all images, giving this work general application towards databases of images and videos from a variety of domains.   we present new algorithms for the automated extraction of color and texture information that use binary set representations of color and texture, respectively. we put special emphasis on the processes of feature extraction and indexing. we demonstrate that our binary feature sets for texture and color provide excellent performance in query response time while maintaining highly effective discriminability, accuracy in spatial localization and capability for extraction from compressed data representations.  we present the color and texture set extraction and indexing techniques and contrast them to other approaches. we examine texture and color searching on databases of 500 and 3000 color images, respectively. finally, we examine the relationship between color and texture in application towards image and video retrieval. we explore the capability of combining the color and texture maps of images to obtain unified feature maps that characterize image regions by both color and texture. in particular, we indicate that by combining modalities we can better capture and index color patterns and characterize real world objects within images and videos. finally, we examine the nature and performance of image and video database queries that combine color and texture.

citee abstract:this work addresses content based image retrieval (cbir), focusing on developing a hidden semantic concept discovery methodology to address effective semantics-intensive image retrieval. in our approach, each image in the database is segmented to region; associated with homogenous color, texture, and shape features. by exploiting regional statistical information in each image and employing a vector quantization method, a uniform and sparse region-based representation is achieved. with this representation a probabilistic model based on statistical-hidden-class assumptions of the image database is obtained, to which expectation-maximization (em) technique is applied to analyze semantic concepts hidden in the database. an elaborated retrieval algorithm is designed to support the probabilistic model. the semantic similarity is measured through integrating the posterior probabilities of the transformed query image, as well as a constructed negative example, to the discovered semantic concepts. the proposed approach has a solid statistical foundation and the experimental evaluations on a database of 10,000 general-purposed images demonstrate its promise of the effectiveness.

citer title:designing novel review ranking systems
citer abstract:with the rapid growth of the internet, users' ability to publish content has created active electronic communities that provide a wealth of product information. consumers naturally gravitate to reading reviews in order to decide whether to buy a product. however, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes it harder for individuals to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product based on the reviews. similarly, the manufacturer of a product needs to identify the reviews that inuence the customer base, and examine the content of these reviews. in this paper, we propose two ranking mechanisms for ranking product reviews: a consumer-oriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected helpfulness, and a manufactureroriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected e?ect on sales. our ranking mechanism combines econometric analysis with text mining techniques in general, and with subjectivity analysis in particular. we show that subjectivity analysis can give useful clues about the helpfulness of a review and about its impact on sales. our results can have several implications for the market design of online opinion forums

citee abstract:the increasing pervasiveness of the internet has dramatically changed the way that consumers shop for goods. consumergenerated product reviews have become a valuable source of information for customers, who read the reviews and decide whether to buy the product based on the information provided. in this paper, we use techniques that decompose the reviews into segments that evaluate the individual characteristics of a product (e.g., image quality and battery life for a digital camera). then, as a major contribution of this paper, we adapt methods from the econometrics literature, specifically the hedonic regression concept, to estimate: (a) the weight that customers place on each individual product feature, (b) the implicit evaluation score that customers assign to each feature, and (c) how these evaluations a?ect the revenue for a given product. towards this goal, we develop a novel hybrid technique combining text mining and econometrics that models consumer product reviews as elements in a tensor product of feature and evaluation spaces. we then impute the quantitative impact of consumer reviews on product demand as a linear functional from this tensor product space. we demonstrate how to use a lowdimension approximation of this functional to signicantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still providing good experimental results. we evaluate our technique using a data set from amazon.com consisting of sales data and the related consumer reviews posted over a 15-month period for 242 products. our experimental evaluation shows that we can extract actionable business intelligence from the data and better understand the customer preferences and actions. we also show that the textual portion of the reviews can improve product sales prediction compared to a baseline technique that simply relies on numeric data.

citee title:the e?ect of word of mouth on sales: online book reviews
citee abstract:the creation of online consumer communities to provide product reviews and advice has been touted as an important, albeit somewhat expensive component of internet retail strategies. in this paper, we characterize reviewer behavior at two popular internet sites and examine the effect of consumer reviews on firms' sales. we use publicly available data from the two leading online booksellers, amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com, to construct measures of each firm's sales of individual books. we also gather extensive consumer review data at the two sites. first, we characterize the reviewer behavior on the two sites such as the distribution of the number of ratings and the valence and length of ratings, as well as ratings across different subject categories. second, we measure the effect of individual reviews on the relative shares of books across the two sites. we argue that our methodology of comparing the sales and reviews of a given book across internet retailers allows us to improve on the existing literature by better capturing a causal relationship between word of mouth (reviews) and sales since we are able to difference out factors that affect the sales and word of mouth of both retailers, such as the book's quality. we examine the incremental sales effects of having reviews for a particular book versus not having reviews and also the differential sales effects of positive and negative reviews. our large database of books also allows us to control for other important confounding factors such as differences across the sites in prices and shipping times

citee abstract:extracting sentiment from text is a hard semantic problem. we develop a methodology for extracting small investor sentiment from stock message boards. the algorithm comprises different classifier algorithms coupled together by a voting scheme. accuracy levels are similar to widely used bayes classifiers, but false positives are lower and sentiment accuracy higher. time series and cross-sectional aggregation of message information improves the quality of the resultant sentiment index, particularly in the presence of slang and ambiguity. empirical applications evidence a relationship with stock valuestech-sector postings are related to stock index levels, and to volumes and volatility. the algorithms may be used to assess the impact on investor opinion of management announcements, press releases, third-party news, and regulatory changes.

citee title:a multi-level examination of the impact of social identities on economic transactions in electronic markets
citee abstract:three of the most important uses of the internet today are as an economic marketplace, as a forum for social interaction, and as a source of information. in this paper, we explore how these three activities come together, in the form of emergent social communities built around information exchanges within it-enabled electronic marketplaces. drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that the relationship between online consumer reviews and internet product sales is partially explained by social identity processes. using a unique dataset based on both chronologically compiled ratings as well as reviewer characteristics for a given set of products and geographical location-based purchasing behavior from amazon, we provide evidence at the community level linking the prevalence of identity claiming behavior in an online community with subsequent product sales. in addition, we show that when reviewers claim to be from a particular geographic location, subsequent product sales are higher in that region. at the review level of analysis, we show that subsequent reviews conform to identity-claiming norms set in previous reviews, and that identity claiming that conforms to community norms elicits identity granting. furthermore, our results suggest that the prevalence of identity granting has implications for economic exchange in the form of product sales. implications for research on word-of-mouth and electronic communities are discussed.

citee title:opinion mining using econometrics: a case study on reputation systems
citee abstract:deriving the polarity and strength of opinions is an important research topic, attracting significant attention over the last few years. in this work, to measure the strength and polarity of an opinion, we consider the economic context in which the opinion is evaluated, instead of using human annotators or linguistic resources. we rely on the fact that text in on-line systems influences the behavior of humans and this effect can be observed using some easy-to-measure economic variables, such as revenues or product prices. by reversing the logic, we infer the semantic orientation and strength of an opinion by tracing the changes in the associated economic variable. in effect, we use econometrics to identify the economic value of text and assign a dollar value to each opinion phrase, measuring sentiment effectively and without the need for manual labeling. we argue that by interpreting opinions using econometrics, we have the first objective, quantifiable, and contextsensitive evaluation of opinions. we make the discussion concrete by presenting results on the reputation system of amazon.com. we show that user feedback affects the pricing power of merchants and by measuring their pricing power we can infer the polarity and strength of the underlying feedback postings.

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:market distortions when agents are better informed: the value of information in real estate transactions
citee abstract:agents are often better informed than the clients who hire them and may exploit this informational advantage. real-estate agents, who know much more about the housing market than the typical homeowner, are one example. because real estate agents receive only a small share of the incremental profit when a house sells for a higher value, there is an incentive for them to convince their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly. we test these predictions by comparing home sales in which real estate agents are hired by others to sell a home to instances in which a real estate agent sells his or her own home. in the former case, the agent has distorted incentives; in the latter case, the agent wants to pursue the first-best. consistent with the theory, we find homes owned by real estate agents sell for about 3.7 percent more than other houses and stay on the market about 9.5 days longer, even after controlling for a wide range of housing characteristics. situations in which the agent's informational advantage is larger lead to even greater distortions.

citee abstract:this paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). the classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. a phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., subtle nuances) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., very cavalier). in this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word excellent minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word poor. a review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). the accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews

citer title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citer abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:mining the peanut gallery: opinion extraction and semantic classification of product reviews
citee abstract:the web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). we begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. the best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. when operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. but in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.

citer abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:automatic detection of text genre
citee abstract:as the text databases available to users become larger and more heterogeneous, genre becomes increasingly important for computational linguistics as a complement to topical and structural principles of classification. we propose a theory of genres as bundles of facets, which correlate with various surface cues, and argue that genre detection based on surface cues is as successful as detection based on deeper structural properties
surrounding text:, editorial, novel, news, poem etc.  although some techniques for genre classification can recognize documents that express opinions [23, ***, 14]<2>, they do not tell whether the opinions are positive or negative.  in our work, we need to determine whether an opinion is positive or negative and to perform opinion classification at the sentence level rather than at the document level

citee title:indexing by latent semantic analysis
citee abstract:a new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. the approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (semantic structure) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. the particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 or- thogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are re- turned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.
surrounding text:yet, it is well known that literal term matching has severe drawbacks, mainly due to the ambivalence of words and their unavoidable lack of precision as well as due to personal style and individual di erences in word usage.  latent semantic analysis (lsa) [***]<1> is an approach to automatic indexing and information retrieval that attempts to overcome these problems by mapping documents as well as terms to a representation in the so{called latent semantic space.  lsa usually takes the (high dimensional) vector space representation of documents based on term frequencies [14]<1> as a starting point and applies a dimension reducing linear projection. 4 probabilistic latent semantic analysis 4. 1 latent semantic analysis as mentioned in the introduction, the key idea of lsa [***]<1> is to map documents (and by symmetry terms) to a vector space of reduced dimensionality, the latent semantic space.  this mapping is computed by decomposing the term/document matrix n with svd, n = uvt, where u and v are orthogonal matrices utu = vtv = i and the diagonal matrix  contains the singular values of n. queries or documents which were not part of the original collection can be folded in by a simple matrix multiplication (cf.

citee abstract:current computational approaches to learning visual object categories require thousands of training images, are slow, cannot learn in an incremental manner and cannot incorporate prior information into the learning process. in addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. we present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. it is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. we test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. a generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. the parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a bayesian manner. our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum-likelihood. the incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. both bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets.

citee abstract:we describe an approach to object and scene retrieval which searches for and localizes all the occurrences of a user outlined object in a video. the object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. the temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. the analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. the result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of google. the method is illustrated for matching on two full length feature films.

citer abstract:this paper explores two aspects of social network modeling. first, we generalize a successful static model of relationships into a dynamic model that accounts for friendships drifting over time. second, we show how to make it tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities n gets large. the generalized model associates each entity with a point in p-dimensional euclidean latent space. the points can move as time progresses but large moves in latent space are improbable. observed links between entities are more likely if the entities are close in latent space. we show how to make such a model tractable (sub-quadratic in the number of entities) by the use of appropriate kernel functions for similarity in latent space; the use of low dimensional kd-trees; a new efficient dynamic adaptation of multidimensional scaling for a first pass of approximate projection of entities into latent space; and an efficient conjugate gradient update rule for non-linear local optimization in which amortized time per entity during an update is o(log n). we use both synthetic and real-world data on up to 11,000 entities which indicate near-linear scaling in computation time and improved performance over four alternative approaches. we also illustrate the system operating on twelve years of nips co-authorship data

citee abstract:the book provides a comprehensive treatment of multidimensional scaling (mds), a family of statistical techniques for analyzing the structure of (dis)similarity data. such data are widespread, including, for example, intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. mds represents the data as distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. this map can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data matrices. mds is also used as a psychological model for judgments of similarity and preference.  this book may be used as an introduction to mds for students in the psychology, sociology, and marketing, in particular. the prerequisite is some elementary background in statistics. the book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on mds topics. all the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed systematically.

citee title:correlated topic models
citee abstract:topic models, such as latent dirichlet allocation (lda), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. the lda model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. a limitation of lda is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than x-ray astronomy. this limitation stems from the use of the dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. in this paper we develop the correlated topic model (ctm), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution . we derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. the ctm gives a better fit than lda on a collection of ocred articles from the journal science. furthermore, the ctm provides a natural way of visualizing and exploring this and other unstructured data sets

(2) a nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. from the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) the filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. the new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. the discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the appendix.

citee abstract:mobile information services will play an important role in our future work and private life. enabling mobility in urban and populous areas needs innovative tools and novel techniques for individual traffic planning. however, though there already are navigation systems featuring route planning, their usability is often difficult, because neither current information nor personal user preferences are incorporated. we present a prototype of a traffic information system offering advanced personalized route planning, including added services like traffic jam alerting by means of sms. the fast changing nature of such data requires to gather it from on-line internet sources. given current bandwidth limitations an asynchronous update strategy of a central service database prepares the ground to meet real-time requirements though providing up-todate information. the top results of a personalized route planning query can be efficiently computed by our srcombine algorithm in less than 3 seconds as practical case studies show. xslt technology automatically converts these results for the delivery to various mobile devices. in summary we give evidence that by intelligently joining latest technologies for preference modeling and preference query evaluation advanced personalized mobile traffic information systems are feasible today.

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee abstract: the  skyline  of  a  set  of   d - dimensional  points  contains  the  points  that  are  not  dominated  by  any  other  point  on  all  dimensions skyline computation has  recently  received  considerable  attention  in the database community, especially for progressive (or online)  algorithms that can quickly return the first skyline points without  having  to  read  the  entire  data  file currently,  the  most  efficient  algorithm  is  nn  (nearest  neighbors),  which  applies  the  divide - and - conquer framework on datasets indexed by r - trees although  nn has some desirable features (such as high speed for returning  the     initial     skyline     points,     applicability     to     arbitrary     data  distributions  and  dimensions),  it  also  presents  several  inherent  disadvantages   (need   for   duplicate   elimination  if    d>2,  multiple  accesses of the same node, large space overhead) in this paper we  develop bbs (branch - and - bound skyline), a progressive algorithm  also based on nearest neighbor search, which is io optimal, i e , it  performs  a  single  access  only  to  those  r - tree  nodes  that  may  contain skyline points furthermore, it does not retrieve duplicates  and  its  space  overhead  is  significantly  smaller  than  that  of  nn finally, bbs is simple to implement and can be efficiently applied  to   a   variety   of   alternative   skyline   queries an   analytical   and  experimental    comparison    shows    that    bbs    outperforms    nn  (usually by orders of magnitude) under all problem instances

citer title:efficient distributed skylining for web information systems
citer abstract:though skyline queries already have claimed their place in retrieval over central databases, their application in web information systems up to now was impossible due to the distributed aspect of retrieval over web sources. but due to the amount, variety and volatile nature of information accessible over the internet extended query capabilities are crucial. we show how to efficiently perform distributed skyline queries and thus essentially extend the expressiveness of querying todays web information systems. together with our innovative retrieval algorithm we also present useful heuristics to further speed up the retrieval in most practical cases paving the road towards meeting even the realtime challenges of on-line information services. we discuss performance evaluations and point to open problems in the concept and application of skylining in modern information systems. for the curse of dimensionality, an intrinsic problem in skyline queries, we propose a novel sampling scheme that allows to get an early impression of the skyline for subsequent query refinement

citee title:pruned query evaluation using pre-computed impacts
citee abstract:exhaustive evaluation of ranked queries can be expensive, particularly when only a small subset of the overall ranking is required, or when queries contain common terms. this concern gives rise to techniques for dynamic query pruning, that is, methods for eliminating redundant parts of the usual exhaustive evaluation, yet still generating a demonstrably "good enough" set of answers to the query. in this work we propose new pruning methods that make use of impact-sorted indexes. compared to exhaustive evaluation, the new methods reduce the amount of computation performed, reduce the amount of memory required for accumulators, reduce the amount of data transferred from disk, and at the same time allow performance guarantees in terms of precision and mean average precision. these strong claims are backed by experiments using the trec terabyte collection and queries.

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee abstract:we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the batch-aware distributed file system (bad-fs), a system designed to orchestrate large, i/o-intensive batch workloads on remote computing clusters distributed across the wide area. bad-fs consists of two novel components: a storage layer that exposes control of traditionally fixed policies such as caching, consistency, and replication; and a scheduler that exploits this control as necessary for different workloads. by extracting control from the storage layer and placing it within an external scheduler, bad-fs manages both storage and computation in a coordinated way while gracefully dealing with cache consistency, fault-tolerance, and space management issues in a workload-specific manner. using both microbenchmarks and real workloads, we demonstrate the performance benefits of explicit control, delivering excellent end-to-end performance across the wide-area.

citee title:cluster-based scalable network services
citee abstract:we identify three fundamental requirements for scalable net-work services: incremental scalability and overflow growth provi-sioning, 24x7 availability through fault masking, and cost-effectiveness. we argue that clusters of commodity workstationsinterconnected by a high-speed san are exceptionally well-suitedto meeting these challenges for internet-server workloads, pro-vided the software infrastructure for managing partial failures andadministering a large cluster does not have to be reinvented foreach new service. to this end, we propose a general, layered archi-tecture for building cluster-based scalable network services thatencapsulates the above requirements for reuse, and a service-pro-gramming model based on composable workers that perform trans-formation, aggregation, caching, and customization (tacc) ofinternet content. for both performance and implementation sim-plicity, the architecture and tacc programming model exploitbase, a weaker-than-acid data semantics that results from trad-ing consistency for availability and relying on soft state for robust-ness in failure management. our architecture can be used as anoff the shelf infrastructural platform for creating new networkservices, allowing authors to focus on the content of the service(by composing tacc building blocks) rather than its implementa-tion. we discuss two real implementations of services based on thisarchitecture: transend, a web distillation proxy deployed to theuc berkeley dialup ip population, and hotbot, the commercialimplementation of the inktomi search engine. we present detailedmeasurements of transends performance based on substantial cli-ent traces, as well as anecdotal evidence from the transend andhotbot experience, to support the claims made for the architecture.

citee abstract:the inference network retrieval model, as implemented in the inquery search engine, allows for richly structured queries. however, it incorporates a form of ad hoc tf.idf estimates for word probabilities. language modeling offers more formal estimation techniques. in this paper we combine the language modeling and inference network approaches into a single framework. the resulting model allows structured queries to be evaluated using language modeling estimates. we explore the issues involved, such as combining beliefs and smoothing of proximity nodes. experimental results are presented comparing the query likelihood model, the inquery system, and our new model. the results reaffirm that high quality structured queries outperform unstructured queries and show that our system consistently achieves higher average precision than inquery.

citee title:self-indexing inverted files for fast text retrieval
citee abstract:query processing costs on large text databases are dominated by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. here we show that query response time for conjunctive boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be dramatically reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each inverted list. this method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. our experimental results show that the selfindexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the inverted file, but, for boolean queries of 5{10 terms, can reduce processing time to under one fifth of the previous cost. similarly, ranked queries of 40{50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval e ectiveness
surrounding text:buckley suggests a method for doing this.  moffat and zobel [***]<2> evaluate two heuristics, quit and continue, which reduce the time necessary to evaluate termata-time queries.  the quit heuristic dynamically adds accumulators while query processing continues, until the number of accumulators meets some fixed threshold

citer title:efficient query evaluation using a two-level retrieval process
citer abstract:we present an efficient query evaluation method based on a two level approach: at the first level, our method iterates in parallel over query term postings and identifies candidate documents using an approximate evaluation taking into account only partial information on term occurrences and no query independent factors; at the second level, promising candidates are fully evaluated and their exact scores are computed. the efficiency of the evaluation process can be improved significantly using dynamic pruning techniques with very little cost in effectiveness. the amount of pruning can be controlled by the user as a function of time allocated for query evaluation. experimentally, using the trec web track data, we have determined that our algorithm significantly reduces the total number of full evaluations by more than 90%, almost without any loss in precision or recall. at the heart of our approach there is an efficient implementation of a new boolean construct called wand or weak and that might be of independent interest

citee title:pivot join: a runtime operator for text search
citee abstract:we consider the problem of efficiently sampling web search engine query results. in turn, using a small random sample instead of the full set of results leads to efficient approximate algorithms for several applications, such as: ? determining the set of categories in a given taxonomy spanned by the search results; ? finding the range of metadata values associated to the result set in order to enable multi-faceted search; ? estimating the size of the result set; ? data mining associations to the query terms. we present and analyze an efficient algorithm for obtaining uniform random samples applicable to any search engine based on posting lists and document-at-a-time evaluation. (to our knowledge, all popular web search engines, e.g. google, inktomi, altavista, alltheweb, belong to this class.) furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to follow the modern object-oriented approach whereby posting lists are viewed as streams equipped with a next method, and the next method for boolean and other complex queries is built from the next method for primitive terms. in our case we show how to construct a basic next(p) method that samples term posting lists with probability p, and show how to construct next(p) methods for boolean operators (and, or, wand) from primitive methods. finally, we test the efficiency and quality of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data.

citee title:space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors
citee abstract:in this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. the paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. the new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. in such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to catch the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. an example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time

citee abstract:there are two main families of technique for eficient processing of ranked queries on large text collections: document-ordered processing and term-ordered processing. in this note we compare these techniques experimentally. we show that they have similar costs for short queries, but that for long queries document-ordered processing is much more costly. overall, we conclude that term-ordered processing, with the refinements of limited accumulators and hierarchical index structuring, is the more eficient mechanism.
surrounding text:turtle and flood demonstrated experimentally that in an environment where it is not possible to store intermediate scores in main memory, optimized daat strategies outperform optimized taat strategies.  in contrast, kaszkiel and zobbel [***]<2> showed that for long queries, the max-score strategy is much more costly than optimized taat strategies, due to the required sorting of term postings at each stage of evaluation.  a process that heavily depends on the number of query terms

citer title:efficient query evaluation using a two-level retrieval process
citer abstract:we present an efficient query evaluation method based on a two level approach: at the first level, our method iterates in parallel over query term postings and identifies candidate documents using an approximate evaluation taking into account only partial information on term occurrences and no query independent factors; at the second level, promising candidates are fully evaluated and their exact scores are computed. the efficiency of the evaluation process can be improved significantly using dynamic pruning techniques with very little cost in effectiveness. the amount of pruning can be controlled by the user as a function of time allocated for query evaluation. experimentally, using the trec web track data, we have determined that our algorithm significantly reduces the total number of full evaluations by more than 90%, almost without any loss in precision or recall. at the heart of our approach there is an efficient implementation of a new boolean construct called wand or weak and that might be of independent interest

citee title:full text indexing based on lexical relations: an application: software libraries
citee abstract:in contrast to other kinds of libraries, software libraries need to be conceptually organized. when looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary. software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large libraries of software components. in this paper, we present guru, a tool that allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented software components. we focus here on guru's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural language documentation. this indexing method is based on words' co-occurrences. it first uses extract, a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual documents. conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context words. this fully automated indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based tools in the understanding of a document without the brittleness of knowledge based tools. the indexing component of guru is fully implemented, and some results are given in the paper

citee title:optimizing queries over multimedia repositories
citee abstract:repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (e.g., image, text) are becoming increasingly common. a selection on these attributes will typically produce not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, indicating how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). also, multimedia repositories may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. we investigate how to optimize the processing of queries over multimedia repositories. a key issue is the choice of the indexes used to search the repository. we define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is np-hard, we solve the problem efficiently when the predicates in the query are independent. we also show that the problem of optimizing queries that ask for a few top-ranked objects can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating selection conditions. thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem.

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citer abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee title:predicate migration: optimizing queries with expensive predicates
citee abstract:the traditional focus of relational query optimization schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join orders. restrictions have typically been handled in query optimizers by "predicate pushdown" rules, which apply restrictions in some random order before as many joins as possible. these rules work under the assumption that restrictions is essentially a zero- time operation. however, today's extensible and object-oriented database systems allow users to define time-consuming functions, which may be used in a query's restriction and join predicates. furthermore, sql has long supported subquery predicates, which may be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. thus restrictions should not be considered zero-time operations, and the model of query optimization must be enhanced. in this paper we develop a theory for moving expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total cost of the plan--including the costs of both joins and restrictions--is minimal. we present an algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results of our implementation in postgres. our experience with the newly enhanced postgres are orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a traditional query optimizer. the additional complexity of considering expensive predicates during optimization is found to be manageably small.

citee title:prefer: a system for the efficient execution of multi-parametric ranked queries
citee abstract:users often need to optimize the selection of objects by ap-propriately weighting the importance of multiple object at-tributes. such optimization problems appear often in opera-tions research and applied mathematics as well as everydaylife; e.g., a buyer may select a home as a weighted functionof a number of attributes like its distance from office, itsprice, its area, etc.we capture such queries in our definition of preferencequeries that use a weight function over a relations attributesto derive a score for each tuple. database systems cannotefficiently produce the top results of a preference query be-cause they need to evaluate the weight function over all tu-ples of the relation. prefer answers preference queriesefficiently by using materialized views that have been pre-processed and stored.we first show how the result of a preference query can beproduced in a pipelined fashion using a materialized view.then we show that excellent performance can be deliveredgiven a reasonable number of materialized views and we pro-vide an algorithm that selects a number of views to precom-pute and materialize given space constraints.we have implemented the algorithms proposed in this pa-per in a prototype system called prefer, which operateson top of a commercial database management system. wepresent the results of a performance comparison, compar-ing our algorithms with prior approaches using syntheticdatasets. our results indicate that the proposed algorithmsare superior in performance compared to other approaches,both in preprocessing (preparation of materialized views) aswell as execution time.

citee title:incremental join queries on ranked inputs
citee abstract:this paper investigates the problem of incremental joins of multiple ranked data sets when the join condition is a list of arbitrary user-defined predicates on the input tuples. this problem arises in many important applications dealing with ordered inputs and multiple ranked data sets, and requiring the top k solutions. we use multimedia applications as the motivating examples but the problem is equally applicable to traditional database applications involving optimal resource allocation, scheduling, decision making, ranking, etc. we propose an algorithmj that enables querying of ordered data sets by imposing arbitrary userdefined join predicates. the basic version of the algorithm does not use any random access but a j pa variation can exploit available indexes for efficient random access based on the join predicates. a special case includes the join scenario considered by fagin  for joins based on identical keys, and in that case, our algorithms perform as efficiently as fagins. our main contribution, however, is the generalization to join scenarios that were previously unsupported, including cases where random access in the algorithm is not possible due to lack of unique keys. in addition, j can support multiple join levels, or nested join hierarchies, which are the norm for modeling multimedia data. we also give -approximation versions of both of the above algorithms. finally, we give strong optimality results for some of the proposed algorithms, and we study their performance empirically

citee title:mining opinion features in customer reviews
citee abstract:it is a common practice that merchants selling products on the web ask their customers to review the products and associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them in order to make a decision on whether to buy the product. in this project, we aim to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we are only interested in the specific features of the product that customers have opinions on and also whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting or rewriting a subset of the original sentences from the reviews to capture their main points as in the classic text summarization. in this paper, we only focus on mining opinion/product features that the reviewers have commented on. a number of techniques are presented to mine such features. our experimental results show that these techniques are highly effective.

citee title:opinion observer: analyzing and comparing opinions on the web
citee abstract:the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. it makes two contributions. first, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented. the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. for a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. for a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews. such features form the basis for the above comparison. experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.

citee abstract:this paper describes a number of applications of the 'k-means', a procedure for classifying a random sample of points in e sub n. the procedure consists of starting with k groups which each consist of a single random point, and thereafter adding the points one after another to the group whose mean each point is nearest. after a point is added to a group, the mean of that group is adjusted so as to take account of the new point. thus at each stage there are in fact k means, one for each group. after the sample is processed in this way, the points are classified on the basis of nearness to the final means. the portions which result tend to be fficient in the sense of having low within class variance. applications are suggested for the problems of non-linear prediction, efficient communication, non-parametric tests of independence, similarity grouping, and automatic file construction. the extension of the methods to general metric spaces is indicated

citee title:seeing stars: exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales
citee abstract:we address the rating-inference problem, wherein rather than simply decide whether a review is "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", as in previous sentiment analysis work, one must determine an author's evaluation with respect to a multi-point scale (e.g., one to five "stars"). this task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, "three stars" is intuitively closer to "four stars" than to "one star".   we first evaluate human performance at the task. then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. we show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of svms when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.

citee title:thumbs up or thumbs down? semantic orientation applied to unsupervised classication of reviews
citee abstract:this paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). the classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. a phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., subtle nuances) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., very cavalier). in this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word excellent minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word poor. a review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). the accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews

surrounding text:in the procedure, a basic clustering algorithm is needed to cluster objects in each layer based on the dened similarity function (equation 1).  in the rst step of iterative reinforcement, we cluster data objects only by their intra relationship without interrelated link information, since in most cases link information is too sparse in the beginning to help the clustering [***]<3>.  then both intra- and inter- relationship are combined in the subsequent steps to iteratively enhance reinforcement

citer abstract:independent component analysis (ica) is a statistical method for transforming an observed multidimen-sional random vector into components that are statistically as independent from each other as possible. in this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear ica: comons information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. using maximum entropy approximations of differential en-tropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ica. these contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of indi-vidual independent components as projection pursuit directions. the statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. finally, we intro-duce simple .xed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. these algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably

citee title:an information-maximization approach to blind separation and blind deconvolution
citee abstract:we derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. the algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (linsker 1989). the nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. this enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. we apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. we also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. we suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing

citee title:equivariant adaptive source separation
citee abstract:source separation consists of recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. this paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation that implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called equivariant adaptive separation via independence (easi). the easi algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating. this specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple structure for both real and complex mixtures. most importantly, the performance of an easi algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. in particular, convergence rates, stability conditions, and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. closed-form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. the theme of equivariance is stressed throughout the paper. the source separation problem has an underlying multiplicative structure. the parameter space forms a (matrix) multiplicative group. we explore the (favorable) consequences of this fact on implementation, performance, and optimization of easi algorithms

citee abstract:the blind source separation problem is to extract the underlying source signals from a set of linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. this situation is common in acoustics, radio, medical signal and image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and other areas. we suggest a two-stage separation process: a priori selection of a possibly overcomplete signal dictionary (for instance, a wavelet frame or a learned dictionary) in which the sources are assumed to be sparsely representable, followed by unmixing the sources by exploiting the their sparse representability. we consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures. experiments with artificial signals and musical sounds demonstrate significantly better separation than other known techniques.

citee abstract:we investigate the complex relationships between countries in the eurovision song contest, by recasting past voting data in terms of a dynamical network. despite the british tendency to feel distant from europe, our analysis shows that the u.k. is remarkably compatible, or 'in tune', with other european countries. equally surprising is our finding that some other core countries, most notably france, are significantly 'out of tune' with the rest of europe. in addition, our analysis enables us to confirm a widely-held belief that there are unofficial cliques of countries -- however these cliques are not always the expected ones, nor can their existence be explained solely on the grounds of geographical proximity. the complexity in this system emerges via the group 'self-assessment' process, and in the absence of any central controller. one might therefore speculate that such complexity is representative of many real-world situations in which groups of 'agents' establish their own inter-relationships and hence ultimately decide their own fate. possible examples include groups of individuals, societies, political groups or even governments.

citee title:learning automata from ordered examples
citee abstract:connectionist learning models have had considerable empirical success, but it is hard to characterize exactly what they learn. the learning of finite-state languages (fsl) from example strings is a domain which has been extensively studied and might provide an opportunity to help understand connectionist learning. a major problem is that traditional fsl learning assumes the storage of all examples and thus violates connectionist principles. this paper presents a provably correct algorithm for inferring any minimum-state deterministic finite-state automata (fsa) from a complete ordered sample using limited total storage and without storing example strings. the algorithm is an iterative strategy that uses at each stage a current encoding of the data considered so far, and one single sample string. one of the crucial advantages of our algorithm is that the total amount of space used in the course of learning for encoding any finite prefix of the sample is polynomial in the size of the inferred minimum state deterministic fsa. the algorithm is also relatively efficient in time and has been implemented. more importantly, there is a connectionist version of the algorithm that preserves these properties. the connectionist version requires much more structure than the usual models and has been implemented using the rochester connectionist simulator. we also show that no machine with finite working storage can iteratively identify the fsl from arbitrary presentations.

citee abstract:we present algorithms for coupling and training hidden markov models (hmms) to model interacting processes, and demonstrate their superiority to conventional hmms in a vision task classifying two-handed actions. hmms are perhaps the most successful framework in perceptual computing for modeling and classifying dynamic behaviors, popular because they offer dynamic time warping, a training algorithm and a clear bayesian semantics. however the markovian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signal-that it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory. the single-process model is often inappropriate for vision (and speech) applications, resulting in low ceilings on model performance. coupled hmms provide an efficient way to resolve many of these problems, and offer superior training speeds, model likelihoods, and robustness to initial conditions.

citee title:extracting knowledge from evaluative text
citee abstract:capturing knowledge from free-form evaluative texts about an entity is a challenging task. new techniques of feature extraction, polarity determination and strength evaluation have been proposed. feature extraction is particularly important to the task as it provides the underpinnings of the extracted knowledge. the work in this paper introduces an improved method for feature extraction that draws on an existing unsupervised method. by including user-specific prior knowledge of the evaluated entity, we turn the task of feature extraction into one of term similarity by mapping crude (learned) features into a user-defined taxonomy of the entity's features. results show promise both in terms of the accuracy of the mapping as well as the reduction in the semantic redundancy of crude features.

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:web data mining: exploring hyperlinks, contents, and usage data
citee abstract:association rule mining is an important model in data mining. its mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. minsup controls the minimum number of data cases that a rule must cover. minconf controls the predictive strength of the rule. since only one minsup is used for the whole database, the model implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the data. this is, however, seldom the case in reallife applications. in many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. if minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. to find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low. this may cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways. this dilemma is called the rare item problem. this paper proposes a novel technique to solve this problem. the technique allows the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items and their varied frequencies in the database. in rule mining, different rules may need to satisfy different minimum supports depending on what items are in the rules. experiment results show that the technique is very effective.

citee title:mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: the prefixspan approach
citee abstract:sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. however, it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as gsp, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach  to reduce the number of candidates to be examined. however, this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequence databases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. in this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns. in this approach, a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smaller projected databases, and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent fragments. based on an initial study of the pattern growth-based sequential pattern mining, freespan , we propose a more efficient method, called psp, which offers ordered growth and reduced projected databases. to further improve the performance, a pseudoprojection technique is developed in prefixspan. a comprehensive performance study shows that prefixspan, in most cases, outperforms the a priori-based algorithm gsp, freespan, and spade  (a sequential pattern mining algorithm that adopts vertical data format), and prefixspan integrated with pseudoprojection is the fastest among all the tested algorithms. furthermore, this mining methodology can be extended to mining sequential patterns with user-specified constraints. the high promise of the pattern-growth approach may lead to its further extension toward efficient mining of other kinds of frequent patterns, such as frequent substructures.

citer abstract:this paper studies the problem of identifying comparative sentences in text documents. the problem is related to but quite different from sentiment/opinion sentence identification or classification. sentiment classification studies the problem of classifying a document or a sentence based on the subjective opinion of the author. an important application area of sentiment/opinion identification is business intelligence as a product manufacturer always wants to know consumers opinions on its products. comparisons on the other hand can be subjective or objective. furthermore, a comparison is not concerned with an object in isolation. instead, it compares the object with others. an example opinion sentence is the sound quality of cd player x is poor. an example comparative sentence is the sound quality of cd player x is not as good as that of cd player y. clearly, these two sentences give different information. their language constructs are quite different too. identifying comparative sentences is also useful in practice because direct comparisons are perhaps one of the most convincing ways of evaluation, which may even be more important than opinions on each individual object. this paper proposes to study the comparative sentence identification problem. it first categorizes comparative sentences into different types, and then presents a novel integrated pattern discovery and supervised learning approach to identifying comparative sentences from text documents. experiment results using three types of documents, news articles, consumer reviews of products, and internet forum postings, show a precision of 79% and recall of 81%. more detailed results are given in the paper

citee title:extracting product features and opinions from reviews
citee abstract:consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews in order to make an informed product choice. this paper introduces opine, an unsupervised information-extraction system which mines reviews in order to build a model of important product features, their evaluation by reviewers, and their relative quality across products.compared to previous work, opine achieves 22% higher precision (with only 3% lower recall) on the feature extraction task. opine's novel use of relaxation labeling for finding the semantic orientation of words in context leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity.

citee title:towards answering opinion questions: separating facts from opinions and identifying the polarity of opinion sentences
citee abstract:opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing. in this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. we present a bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. we also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee abstract:the evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., "honest", "intrepid") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., "disturbing", "superfluous"). semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). an automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). this paper introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (pmi) and latent semantic analysis (lsa). the method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). the method attains an accuracy of 82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.

citee title:towards answering opinion questions: separating facts from opinions and identifying the polarity of opinion sentences
citee abstract:opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing. in this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. we present a bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. we also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).

citee title:a maximum entropy approach to adaptive statistical  language modeling
citee abstract:anadaptive statistical language model is described, which successfully integrates long distance linguistic information with other knowledge sources. most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. to extract information from further back in the documents history, we propose and use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. this allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. instead, we apply the principle of maximum entropy (me). each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. the intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. the function with the highest entropy within that set is the me solution. given consistent statistical evidence, a unique me solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. the me framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. an adaptive language model based on the me approach was trained on the wall street journal corpus, and showed 32%c39% perplexity reduction over the baseline. when interfaced to sphinx-ii, carnegie mellons speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10%c14%. this thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework.

citer abstract:top-k query processing is an important building block for ranked retrieval, with applications ranging from text and data integration to distributed aggregation of network logs and sensor data. top-k queries operate on index lists for a querys elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. one of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans as early as possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. this procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. this entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses: 1) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and 2) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates. the prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. the current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a knapsackrelated optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for random accesses. the methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations. in performance experiments with three different datasets (trec terabyte, http server logs, and imdb), our methods achieved significant performance gains compared to the best previously known methods

citee title:eddies: continuously adaptive query processing
citee abstract:in large federated and shared-nothing databases, resources can exhibit widely fluctuating characteristics. assumptions made at the time a query is submitted will rarely hold throughout the duration of query processing. as a result, traditional static query optimization and execution techniques are ineffective in these environments. in this paper we introduce a query processing mechanism called an eddy, which continuously reorders operators in a query plan as it runs. we characterize the...
surrounding text:their approach is based on a dbms-oriented compile-time view: they consider only binary rank joins and a join tree to combine the index lists for all attributes or keywords of the query, and they generate the execution plan before query execution starts.  an alternative, run-time-oriented, approach follows the eddies-style notion of adaptive join orders on a per tuple basis [***]<2> rather than fixing join orders at compiletime.  then the query optimization for top-k queries with threshold-driven evaluation becomes a scheduling problem. this is the approach that we pursue in this paper.  in contrast to [***, 15]<2> we do not restrict ourselves to trees of binary joins, but consider all index lists relevant to the query together.  475 list 1 list 2 list 3 doc17 : 0

citee abstract:though skyline queries already have claimed their place in retrieval over central databases, their application in web information systems up to now was impossible due to the distributed aspect of retrieval over web sources. but due to the amount, variety and volatile nature of information accessible over the internet extended query capabilities are crucial. we show how to efficiently perform distributed skyline queries and thus essentially extend the expressiveness of querying todays web information systems. together with our innovative retrieval algorithm we also present useful heuristics to further speed up the retrieval in most practical cases paving the road towards meeting even the realtime challenges of on-line information services. we discuss performance evaluations and point to open problems in the concept and application of skylining in modern information systems. for the curse of dimensionality, an intrinsic problem in skyline queries, we propose a novel sampling scheme that allows to get an early impression of the skyline for subsequent query refinement

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee title:minimal probing: supporting expensive predicates for top-k queries
citee abstract:this paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked topfi queries with expensive predicates. as major dbmss now all support expensive user-defined predicates for boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries will be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. third, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. these predicates, being dynamically defined or externally accessed, cannot rely on index mechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output, and must instead require per-object probe to evaluate. the current standard sort-merge framework for ranked queries cannot efficiently handle such predicates because it must completely probe all objects, before sorting and merging them to produce topfi answers. to minimize expensive probes, we thus develop the formal principle of necessary probes, which determines if a probe is absolutely required. we then propose algorithm mpro which, by implementing the principle, is provably optimal with minimal probe cost. further, we show that mpro can scale well and can be easily parallelized. our experiments using both a real-estate benchmark database and synthetic datasets show that mpro enables significant probe reduction, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the standard scheme using complete probing

citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee title:supporting top-k join queries in relational databases
citee abstract:ranking queries produce results that are ordered on some computed score. typically, these queries involve joins, where users are usually interested only in the top-k join results. current relational query processors do not handle ranking queries efficiently, especially when joins are involved. in this paper, we address supporting top-k join queries in relational query processors. we introduce a new rank-join algorithm that makes use of the individual orders of its inputs to produce join results ordered on a userspecified scoring function. the idea is to rank the join results progressively during the join operation. we introduce two physical query operators based on variants of ripple join that implement the rankjoin algorithm. the operators are non-blocking and can be integrated into pipelined execution plans. we address several practical issues and optimization heuristics to integrate the new join operators in practical query processors. we implement the new operators inside a prototype database engine based on predator. the experimental evaluation of our approach compares recent algorithms for joining ranked inputs and shows superior performance

citee abstract:large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. a major factor in the cost of executing a query is given by the lengths of the inverted lists for the query terms, which increase with the size of the document collection and are often in the range of many megabytes. to address this issue, ir and database researchers have proposed pruning techniques that compute or approximate term-based ranking functions without scanning over the full inverted lists. over the last few years, search engines have incorporated new types of ranking techniques that exploit aspects such as the hyperlink structure of the web or the popularity of a page to obtain improved results. we focus on the question of how such techniques can be efficiently integrated into query processing. in particular, we study ʿҲʶpruning techniques for query execution in large engines in the case where we have a global ranking of pages, as provided by pagerank or any other method, in addition to the standard term-based approach. we describe pruning schemes for this case and evaluate their efficiency on an experimental clusterbased search engine with  million web pages. our results show that there is significant potential benefit in such techniques.

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee title:self-indexing inverted files for fast text retrieval
citee abstract:query processing costs on large text databases are dominated by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. here we show that query response time for conjunctive boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be dramatically reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each inverted list. this method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. our experimental results show that the selfindexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the inverted file, but, for boolean queries of 5{10 terms, can reduce processing time to under one fifth of the previous cost. similarly, ranked queries of 40{50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval e ectiveness

citer title:minimal probing: supporting expensive predicates for top-k queries
citer abstract:this paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked topfi queries with expensive predicates. as major dbmss now all support expensive user-defined predicates for boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries will be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. third, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. these predicates, being dynamically defined or externally accessed, cannot rely on index mechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output, and must instead require per-object probe to evaluate. the current standard sort-merge framework for ranked queries cannot efficiently handle such predicates because it must completely probe all objects, before sorting and merging them to produce topfi answers. to minimize expensive probes, we thus develop the formal principle of necessary probes, which determines if a probe is absolutely required. we then propose algorithm mpro which, by implementing the principle, is provably optimal with minimal probe cost. further, we show that mpro can scale well and can be easily parallelized. our experiments using both a real-estate benchmark database and synthetic datasets show that mpro enables significant probe reduction, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the standard scheme using complete probing

citee abstract:the advent of the world wide web has created an explosion in the available on-line information. as the range of potential choices expand, the time and effort required to sort through them also expands. we propose a formal framework for expressing and combining user preferences to address this problem. preferences can be used to focus search queries and to order the search results. a preference is expressed by the user for an entity which is described by a set of named fields; each field can take on values from a certain type. the * symbol may be used to match any element of that type. a set of preferences can be combined using a generic combine operator which is instantiated with a value function, thus providing a great deal of flexibility. same preferences can be combined in more than one way and a combination of preferences yields another preference thus providing the closure property. we demonstrate the power of our framework by illustrating how a currently popular personalization system and a real-life application can be realized as special cases of our framework. we also discuss implementation of the framework in a relational setting.

citee title:predicate migration: optimizing queries with expensive predicates
citee abstract:the traditional focus of relational query optimization schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join orders. restrictions have typically been handled in query optimizers by "predicate pushdown" rules, which apply restrictions in some random order before as many joins as possible. these rules work under the assumption that restrictions is essentially a zero- time operation. however, today's extensible and object-oriented database systems allow users to define time-consuming functions, which may be used in a query's restriction and join predicates. furthermore, sql has long supported subquery predicates, which may be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. thus restrictions should not be considered zero-time operations, and the model of query optimization must be enhanced. in this paper we develop a theory for moving expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total cost of the plan--including the costs of both joins and restrictions--is minimal. we present an algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results of our implementation in postgres. our experience with the newly enhanced postgres are orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a traditional query optimizer. the additional complexity of considering expensive predicates during optimization is found to be manageably small.

citer title:minimal probing: supporting expensive predicates for top-k queries
citer abstract:this paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked topfi queries with expensive predicates. as major dbmss now all support expensive user-defined predicates for boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries will be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. third, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. these predicates, being dynamically defined or externally accessed, cannot rely on index mechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output, and must instead require per-object probe to evaluate. the current standard sort-merge framework for ranked queries cannot efficiently handle such predicates because it must completely probe all objects, before sorting and merging them to produce topfi answers. to minimize expensive probes, we thus develop the formal principle of necessary probes, which determines if a probe is absolutely required. we then propose algorithm mpro which, by implementing the principle, is provably optimal with minimal probe cost. further, we show that mpro can scale well and can be easily parallelized. our experiments using both a real-estate benchmark database and synthetic datasets show that mpro enables significant probe reduction, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the standard scheme using complete probing

citee title:optimizing queries over multimedia repositories
citee abstract:repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (e.g., image, text) are becoming increasingly common. a selection on these attributes will typically produce not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, indicating how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). also, multimedia repositories may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. we investigate how to optimize the processing of queries over multimedia repositories. a key issue is the choice of the indexes used to search the repository. we define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is np-hard, we solve the problem efficiently when the predicates in the query are independent. we also show that the problem of optimizing queries that ask for a few top-ranked objects can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating selection conditions. thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem.
surrounding text:these predicates, be they user defined or externally accessed, can be arbitrarily expensive to probe, potentially requiring complex computation or access to networked sources.  note that it may appear straightforward to transform an expensive predicate into a normal one: by probing every object for its score, one can build a search index for the predicate (to access objects scored above a threshold or in the sorted order), as required by the current processing frameworks [***, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<2> (section 3. 3).

citee title:a system for the efficient execution of multi-parametric ranked queries
citee abstract:users often need to optimize the selection of objects by appropriately weighting the importance of multiple object attributes. such optimization problems appear often in operations research and applied mathematics as well as everyday life; e.g., a buyer may select a home as a weighted function of a number of attributes like its distance from office, its price, its area, etc. we capture such queries in our definition of preference queries that use a weight function over a relations attributes to derive a score for each tuple. database systems cannot efficiently produce the top results of a preference query because they need to evaluate the weight function over all tuples of the relation. prefer answers preference queries efficiently by using materialized views that have been preprocessed and stored. we first show how the result of a preference query can be produced in a pipelined fashion using a materialized view. then we show that excellent performance can be delivered given a reasonable number of materialized views and we provide an algorithm that selects a number of views to precompute and materialize given space constraints. we have implemented the algorithms proposed in this paper in a prototype system called prefer, which operates on top of a commercial database management system. we present the results of a performance comparison, comparing our algorithms with prior approaches using synthetic datasets. our results indicate that the proposed algorithms are superior in performance compared to other approaches, both in preprocessing (preparation of materialized views) as well as execution time.

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citer title:minimal probing: supporting expensive predicates for top-k queries
citer abstract:this paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked topfi queries with expensive predicates. as major dbmss now all support expensive user-defined predicates for boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries will be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. third, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. these predicates, being dynamically defined or externally accessed, cannot rely on index mechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output, and must instead require per-object probe to evaluate. the current standard sort-merge framework for ranked queries cannot efficiently handle such predicates because it must completely probe all objects, before sorting and merging them to produce topfi answers. to minimize expensive probes, we thus develop the formal principle of necessary probes, which determines if a probe is absolutely required. we then propose algorithm mpro which, by implementing the principle, is provably optimal with minimal probe cost. further, we show that mpro can scale well and can be easily parallelized. our experiments using both a real-estate benchmark database and synthetic datasets show that mpro enables significant probe reduction, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the standard scheme using complete probing

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee title:top-k selection queries over relational databases: mapping strategies and performance evaluation
citee abstract:in many applications, users specify target values for certain attributes, without requiring exact matches to these values in return. instead, the result to such queries is typically a rank of the "top k" tuples that best match the given attribute values. in this paper, we study the advantages and limitations of processing a top-k query by translating it into a single range query that a traditional relational database management system (rdbms) can process efficiently. in particular, we study how to determine a range query to evaluate a top-k query by exploiting the statistics available to an rdbms, and the impact of the quality of these statistics on the retrieval efficiency of the resulting scheme. we also report the first experimental evaluation of the mapping strategies over a real rdbms, namely over microsoft's sql server 7.0. the experiments show that our new techniques are robust and significantly more efficient than previously known strategies requiring at least one sequential scan of the data sets.

citee title:optimal aggregation algorithms for middleware
citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee abstract:we present a new family of join algorithms, called ripple joins, for online processing of multi-table aggregation queries in a rela- tional database management system (dbms). such queries arise naturally in interactive exploratory decision-support applications. traditional offline join algorithms are designed to minimize the time to completion of the query. in contrast, ripple joins are designed to minimize the time until an acceptably precise esti- mate of the query result is available, as measured by the length of a confidence interval. ripple joins are adaptive, adjusting their behavior during processing in accordance with the statis- tical properties of the data. ripple joins also permit the user to dynamically trade off the two key performance factors of on- line aggregation: the time between successive updates of the run- ning aggregate, and the amount by which the confidence-interval length decreases at each update. we show how ripple joins can be implemented in an existing dbms using iterators, and we give an overview of the methods used to compute confidence intervals and to adaptively optimize the ripple join aspect-ratio parameters. in experiments with an initial implementation of our algorithms in the postgres dbms, the time required to produce reasonably precise online estimates was up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the time required for the best offline join algorithms to pro- duce exact answers.

citee abstract:the authors describe their approach to the optimization of query execution plans in xprs, a multi-user parallel database machine based on a shared-memory multi-processor and a disk array. the main difficulties in this optimization problem are the compile-time unknown parameters such as available buffer size and number of free processors, and the enormous search space of possible parallel plans. the authors deal with these problems with a novel two phase optimization strategy which dramatically reduces the search space and allows run time parameters without significantly compromising plan optimality. they present their two phase strategy and give experimental evidence from xprs benchmarks that indicate that it almost always produces optimal plans

citer abstract:large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. a major factor in the cost of executing a query is given by the lengths of the inverted lists for the query terms, which increase with the size of the document collection and are often in the range of many megabytes. to address this issue, ir and database researchers have proposed pruning techniques that compute or approximate term-based ranking functions without scanning over the full inverted lists. over the last few years, search engines have incorporated new types of ranking techniques that exploit aspects such as the hyperlink structure of the web or the popularity of a page to obtain improved results. we focus on the question of how such techniques can be efficiently integrated into query processing. in particular, we study ʿҲʶpruning techniques for query execution in large engines in the case where we have a global ranking of pages, as provided by pagerank or any other method, in addition to the standard term-based approach. we describe pruning schemes for this case and evaluate their efficiency on an experimental clusterbased search engine with  million web pages. our results show that there is significant potential benefit in such techniques.

citee title:evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases
citee abstract:a query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or top k pages for the query. this top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. for example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. a user who queries such a relation might simply specify the users location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. one critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. in this paper, we study how to process topk queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. we present several algorithms for processing such queries, and evaluate them thoroughly using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

citee abstract:the information explosion across the internet and elswhere offers access to an increasing number of document collections. in order for users to effectively access these collections, information retrieval (ir) systems must provide coordinated, concurrent, and distributed access. in this article, we explore how to achieve scalable performance in a distributed system for collection sizes ranging from 1gb to 128gb. we implement a fully functional distributed ir system based on a multithreaded version of the inquery simulation model. we measure performance as a function of system parameters such as client command rate, number of document collections, ter ms per query, query term frequency, number of answers returned, and command mixture. our results show that it is important to model both query and document commands because the heterogeneity of commands significantly impacts performance. based on our results, we recommend simple changes to the prototype and evaluate the changes using the simulator. because of the significant resource demands of information retrieval, it is not difficult to generate workloads that overwhelm system resources regardless of the architecture. however under some realistic workloads, we demonstrate system organizations for which response time gracefully degrades as the workload increases and performance scales with the number of processors. this scalable architecture includes a surprisingly small number of brokers through which a large number of clients and servers communicate.

citee title:optimizing queries over multimedia repositories
citee abstract:repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (e.g., image, text) are becoming increasingly common. a selection on these attributes will typically produce not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, indicating how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). also, multimedia repositories may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. we investigate how to optimize the processing of queries over multimedia repositories. a key issue is the choice of the indexes used to search the repository. we define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is np-hard, we solve the problem efficiently when the predicates in the query are independent. we also show that the problem of optimizing queries that ask for a few top-ranked objects can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating selection conditions. thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem.

citee abstract:assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for eachof m attributes. for example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. for each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, suchas min or average. to determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. fagin has given an algorithm (fagins algorithm, or fa) that is much more efficient. for some monotone aggregation functions, fa is optimal with high probability in the worst case. we analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (the threshold algorithm, or ta) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than fa. we show that ta is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. unlike fa, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), ta requires only a small, constant-size buffer. ta allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. we distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). we consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. r 2003 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

citee title:scalable distributed architectures for information retrieval
citee abstract:as information explodes across the internet and intranets, information retrieval (ir) systems must cope with the challenge of scale. how to provide scalable performance for rapidly increasing data and workloads is critical in the design of next generation information retrieval systems. this dissertation studies scalable distributed ir architectures that not only provide quick response but also maintain acceptable retrieval accuracy. our distributed architectures exploit parallelism in information retrieval on a cluster of parallel ir servers using symmetric multiprocessors, and use partial collection replication and selection as well as collection selection to restrict the search to a small percentage of data while maintaining retrieval accuracy. we first investigate using partial collection replication for ir systems. we examine query locality in real systems, how to select a partial replica based on relevance, how to load-balance between replicas and the original collection, as well as updating overheads and strategies. our results show that there exists sufficient query locality to justify partial replication for information retrieval. our proposed replica selection algorithm effectively selects relevant partial replicas, and is inexpensive to implement. our evidence also indicates that partial replication achieves better performance than caching queries, because the replica selection algorithm finds similarity between non-identical queries, and thus increases observed locality. we use a validated simulator to perform a detailed performance evaluation of distributed ir architectures. we explore how best to build parallel ir servers using symmetric multiprocessors, evaluate the performance of partial collection replication and collection selection, and compare the performance of partial collection replication with collection partitioning as well as collection selection.

citee title:a probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing, filtering and retrieval
citee abstract:semantic filtering and retrieval of multimedia content is crucial for efficient use of the multimedia data repositories. video query by semantic keywords is one of the most difficult problems in multimedia data retrieval. the difficulty lies in the mapping between low-level video representation and high-level semantics. we therefore formulate the multimedia content access problem as a multimedia pattern recognition problem. we propose a probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing, which can support filtering and retrieval and facilitate efficient content-based access. to map low-level features to high-level semantics we propose probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects). examples of multijects in movies include explosion, mountain, beach, outdoor, music etc. semantic concepts in videos interact and to model this interaction explicitly, we propose a network of multijects (multinet). using probabilistic models for six site multijects, rocks, sky, snow, water-body, forestry/greenery and outdoor and using a bayesian belief network as the multinet we demonstrate the application of this framework to semantic indexing.we demonstrate how detection performance can be significantly improved using the multinet to take interconceptual relationships into account. we also show how the multinet can fuse heterogeneous features to support detection based on inference and reasoning.
surrounding text:less attention, however, has been focused on text-based image retrieval, an arguably more difficult task where a user submits a text query to find matching images for which there is no related text.  previous approaches have essentially treated this task as a classification problem, handling specific queries from a vocabulary of about five words [***]<2>.  in contrast, by using the conditional distribution of words given an image, our approach can handle arbitrary queries from a large vocabulary

citer abstract:we consider the problem of modeling annotated datadata with multiple types where the instance of one type (such as a caption) serves as a description of the other type (such as an image). we describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models which aim to describe such data, culminating in correspondence latent dirichlet allocation, a latent variable model that is e ective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type. we conduct experiments on the corel database of images and captions, assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood, automatic annotation, and text-based image retrieval

citee title:a language modeling approach to information retrieval
citee abstract:models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied. the integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. we argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. this suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. however, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. we estimate models for each document individually. our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. one advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. we have implemented our model and tested it empirically. our approach significantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two different collections and query sets.
surrounding text:in contrast, by using the conditional distribution of words given an image, our approach can handle arbitrary queries from a large vocabulary.  we use a unique form of the language modeling approach to information retrieval [***]<1> where the document language models are derived from images rather than words.  for each unannotated image, we obtain an image-specific distribution over words by computing the conditional distribution p(w j r) which is available for the models described in section 3

citee title:latent dirichlet allocation
citee abstract:we describe latent dirichlet allocation (lda), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. lda is a three-level hierarchical bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. in the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. we present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an em algorithm for empirical bayes parameter estimation. we report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic lsi model
surrounding text:conclusions the example that motivated this project comes from latent semantic analysis in text modeling.  in a commonly cited model, the latent dirichlet allocation model [***]<1>, a dirichlet prior is incorporated into a generative model for a text corpus, where every multinomial drawn from it represents how a document is mixed in terms of topics.  for example, a document might spend 1/3 of its words discussing statistics, 1/2 on numerical methods, and 1/6 on algebraic topology

citee abstract:in this work, we discuss and evaluate solutions to text classification problems associated with the events that are reported in on-line source of news. we present solutions to three related classification problems: new event detection, event clustering, and event tracking. the primary focus of this thesis is new event detection, where the goal is to identify news stories that have not previously reported, in a stream of broadcast news comprising radio, television, and newswire. we present an algorithm for new event detection, and analyze the effects of incorporating domain properties into the classification algorithm. we explore a solution that models the temporal relationship between news stories, and investigate the use of proper noun phrase extraction to capture the who, what, when, and where contained in news. our results for new event detection suggest that previous approaches to document clustering provide a good basis for an approach to new event detection, and that further improvements to classification accuracy are obtained when the domain properties of broadcast news are modeled. new event detection is related to the problem of event clustering, where the goal is to group stories that discuss the same event. we investigate on-line clustering as an approach to new event detection, and re-evaluate existing cluster comparison strategies previously used for document retrieval. our results suggest that these strategies produce different groupings of events, and that the on-line single-link strategy extended with a model for domain properties is faster and more effective than other approaches. in this dissertation, we explore several test representation issues in the context of event tracking, where a classifier for an event is formulated from one or more sample stories. the classifier is used to monitor the subsequent news stream for documents related to the event.

citee title:correlated topic models
citee abstract:topic models, such as latent dirichlet allocation (lda), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. the lda model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. a limitation of lda is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than x-ray astronomy. this limitation stems from the use of the dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. in this paper we develop the correlated topic model (ctm), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution . we derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. the ctm gives a better fit than lda on a collection of ocred articles from the journal science. furthermore, the ctm provides a natural way of visualizing and exploring this and other unstructured data sets

surrounding text:this permits us to analyze the popularity of various topics as a function of time.  another proposed model called the dynamic topic models (dtm) [***]<2> takes a slightly different approach.  the dtm explicitly models the evolution of topics with time by estimating the topic distribution at various epochs. 1 analysis of science we analyzed a subset of 30,000 articles from science, 250 from each of the 120 years between 1883 and 2002.  this is essentially the same data used by blei and lafferty in their experiments with the dtm [***]<2>.  we divided the data into 16 chunks, each consisting of 1875 documents. this term converts the probability of a string to the probability of the corresponding counts vector allowing us to directly compare the perplexities of both the models.  hence the perplexity numbers we show in the plots for lda may not directly correspond to the values obtained by previous authors [2, ***]<2>.  for our experiments, we split the data time wise into 8 chunks each spanning 15 years and comprising 3750 documents as done in section 4. notwithstanding this fact, the multiscale model is still very useful since it allows us to visualize data better, through the multiscale analysis as we have shown earlier.  finally, we note that the dtm [***]<2>, on the contrary, reported slightly lower perplexity than lda.  unlike the dtm which uses full bayesian estimation, we use map estimation to keep the the algorithm simple. the new approach, based on non-homogeneous poisson processes, combined with multi-scale haar wavelet analysis is a more natural way to do sequence modeling of counts-data than previous approaches.  the new model offers us the best features of both the tot [13]<2> and dtm [***]<2> models.  while tot models the probability of occurrence of a topic with time, dtm models the evolution of topic content

citee abstract:the focus of this article is a new class of models, bayesian multi scale models (bmsm's), for phenomena with two defining characteristics: (1) the observed data may be well modeled as a discrete signal (time series) of independent poisson counts, and (2) the underlying intensity function potentially has structure at multiple scales. fundamental to the analysis of such data is the estimation of the underlying intensity function, and it is this problem in particular that is addressed. knowledge of the intensity may be a goal in itself or may serve as an initial step prior to higher-level analyses (e.g., detection or classification).

citee title:bursty and hierarchical structure in streams
citee abstract:a fundamental problem in text data mining is to extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time. e-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. the published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise --- that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a "burst of activity," with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.the goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such "bursts," in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. the approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions; in some ways, it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. the resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.

citer abstract:this paper presents an lda-style topic model that captures not only the low-dimensional structure of data, but also how the structure changes over time. unlike other recent work that relies on markov assumptions or discretization of time, here each topic is associated with a continuous distribution over timestamps, and for each generated document, the mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both word co-occurrences and the documents timestamp. thus, the meaning of a particular topic can be relied upon as constant, but the topics?occurrence and correlations change significantly over time. we present results on nine months of personal email, 17 years of nips research papers and over 200 years of presidential state-of-the-union addresses, showing improved topics, better timestamp prediction, and interpretable trends

citee title:continuous time bayesian networks
citee abstract:in this paper we present a language for finite state continuous time bayesian networks (ctbns), which describe structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time. the state of the system is decomposed into a set of local variables whose values change over time. the dynamics of the system are described by specifying the behavior of each local variable as a function of its parents in a directed (possibly cyclic) graph. the model specifies, at any given point in time, the distribution over two aspects: when a local variable changes its value and the next value it takes. these distributions are determined by the variable's current value and the current values of its parents in the graph. more formally, each variable is modelled as a finite state continuous time markov process whose transition intensities are functions of its parents. we present a probabilistic semantics for the language in terms of the generative model a ctbn defines over sequences of events. we list types of queries one might ask of a ctbn, discuss the conceptual and computational difficulties associated with exact inference, and provide an algorithm for approximate inference which takes advantage of the structure within the process

citee title:the author-topic model for authors and documents
citee abstract:we introduce the author-topic model, a generative model for documents that extends latent dirichlet allocation (lda; blei, ng, & jordan, 2003) to include authorship information. each author is associated with a multinomial distribution over topics and each topic is associated with a multinomial distribution over words. a document with multiple authors is modeled as a distribution over topics that is a mixture of the distributions associated with the authors. we apply the model to a collection of 1,700 nips conference papers and 160,000 citeseer s. exact inference is intractable for these datasets and we use gibbs sampling to estimate the topic and author distributions. we compare the performance with two other generative models for documents, which are special cases of the author-topic model: lda (a topic model) and a simple author model in which each author is associated with a distribution over words rather than a distribution over topics. we show topics recovered by the authortopic model, and demonstrate applications to computing similarity between authors and entropy of author output

citee title:dynamic social network analysis using latent space models
citee abstract:this paper explores two aspects of social network modeling. first, we generalize a successful static model of relationships into a dynamic model that accounts for friendships drifting over time. second, we show how to make it tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities n gets large. the generalized model associates each entity with a point in p-dimensional euclidean latent space. the points can move as time progresses but large moves in latent space are improbable. observed links between entities are more likely if the entities are close in latent space. we show how to make such a model tractable (sub-quadratic in the number of entities) by the use of appropriate kernel functions for similarity in latent space; the use of low dimensional kd-trees; a new efficient dynamic adaptation of multidimensional scaling for a first pass of approximate projection of entities into latent space; and an efficient conjugate gradient update rule for non-linear local optimization in which amortized time per entity during an update is o(log n). we use both synthetic and real-world data on up to 11,000 entities which indicate near-linear scaling in computation time and improved performance over four alternative approaches. we also illustrate the system operating on twelve years of nips co-authorship data

citee title:modeling and predicting personal information dissemination behavior
citee abstract:in this paper, we propose a new way to automatically model and predict human behavior of receiving and disseminating information by analyzing the contact and content of personal communications. a personal profile, called communitynet, is established for each individual based on a novel algorithm incorporating contact, content, and time information simultaneously. it can be used for personal social capital management. clusters of communitynets provide a view of informal networks for organization management. our new algorithm is developed based on the combination of dynamic algorithms in the social network field and the semantic content classification methods in the natural language processing and machine learning literatures. we tested communitynets on the enron email corpus and report experimental results including filtering, prediction, and recommendation capabilities. we show that the personal behavior and intention are somewhat predictable based on these models. for instance, "to whom a person is going to send a specific email" can be predicted by ones personal social network and content analysis. experimental results show the prediction accuracy of the proposed adaptive algorithm is 58% better than the social network-based predictions, and is 75% better than an aggregated model based on latent dirichlet allocation with social network enhancement. two online demo systems we developed that allow interactive exploration of communitynet are also discussed

citee title:yahoo! for amazon: sentiment parsing from small talk on the web
citee abstract:the internet has made it feasible to tap a continuous stream of public sentiment from the world wide web, quite literally permitting one to "feel the pulse" of any issue under consideration. we present a methodology for real time sentiment extraction in the domain of finance. with the advent of the web, there has been a sharp increase in the influence of individuals on the stock market via web-based trading and the posting of sentiment to stock message boards. while it is important  to capture this "sentiment" of small investors, as yet, no index of sentiment has been compiled. this paper comprises (a) a technology for extracting small investor sentiment from web sources to create an index, and (b) illustrative applications of the methodology. we make use of computerized natural language and statistical algorithms for the automated classification of messages posted on the web. we design a suite of classification algorithms, each of different theoretical content, with a view to characterizing the sentiment of any single posting to a message board. the use of multiple methods allows imposition of voting rules in the classification process. it also enables elimination of "fuzzy" messages which are better off uninterpreted. a majority rule across algorithms vastly improves classification accuracy, but also leads to a natural increase in the number of messages classified as "fuzzy". the classifier achieves an accuracy of 62% (versus a random classification accuracy of 33%), and compares favorably against human agreement on message classification, which was 72%. the technology is computationally efficient, allowing the access and interpretations of thousands of messages within minutes. our illustrative applications show evidence of a strong link between market movements and sentiment. based on approximately 25,000 messages for the last quarter of 2000, we found evidence that sentiment is based on stock movements.

citee title:using suffix arrays to compute term frequency and document frequency for all substrings in a corpus
citee abstract:bigrams and trigrams are commonly used in statistical natural language processing; this paper will describe techniques for working with much longer n-grams. suffix arrays (manber and myers 1990) were first introduced to compute the frequency and location of a substring (n-gram) in a sequence (corpus) of length n. to compute frequencies over all n(n + 1)/2 substrings in a corpus, the substrings are grouped into a manageable number of equivalence classes. in this way, a prohibitive computation over substrings is reduced to a manageable computation over classes. this paper presents both the algorithms and the code that were used to compute term frequency (tf) and document frequency (dr)for all n-grams in two large corpora, an english corpus of 50 million words of wall street journal and a japanese corpus of 216 million characters of mainichi shimbun.the second half of the paper uses these frequencies to find "interesting" substrings. lexicographers have been interested in n-grams with high mutual information (mi) where the joint term frequency is higher than what would be expected by chance, assuming that the parts of the n-gram combine independently. residual inverse document frequency (ridf) compares document frequency to another model of chance where terms with a particular term frequency are distributed randomly throughout the collection. mi tends to pick out phrases with noncompositional semantics (which often violate the independence assumption) whereas ridf tends to highlight technical terminology, names, and good keywords for information retrieval (which tend to exhibit nonrandom distributions over documents). the combination of both mi and ridf is better than either by itself in a japanese word extraction task.

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee abstract:with the tremendous amount of information that becomes available on the web on a daily basis, the ability to quickly develop information agents has become a crucial problem. a vital component of any web-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex document into a series of easier extraction tasks. we introduce an inductive algorithm, stalker, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based on user-labeled training examples. labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results show that stalker does significantly better then other approaches; on one hand, stalker requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms, while on the other hand it can handle information sources that could not be wrapped by existing techniques.

citer abstract:the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. it makes two contributions. first, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented. the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. for a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. for a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews. such features form the basis for the above comparison. experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly

citee title:towards answering opinion questions: separating facts from opinions and identifying the polarity of opinion sentences
citee abstract:opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing. in this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. we present a bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. we also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).

citee title:web data extraction based on partial tree alignment
citee abstract:this paper studies the problem of extracting data from a web page that contains several structured data records. the objective is to segment these data records, extract data items/fields from them and put the data in a database table. this problem has been studied by several researchers. however, existing methods still have some serious limitations. the first class of methods is based on machine learning, which requires human labeling of many examples from each web site that one is interested in extracting data from. the process is time consuming due to the large number of sites and pages on the web. the second class of algorithms is based on automatic pattern discovery. these methods are either inaccurate or make many assumptions. this paper proposes a new method to perform the task automatically. it consists of two steps, (1) identifying individual data records in a page, and (2) aligning and extracting data items from the identified data records. for step 1, we propose a method based on visual information to segment data records, which is more accurate than existing methods. for step 2, we propose a novel partial alignment technique based on tree matching. partial alignment means that we align only those data fields in a pair of data records that can be aligned (or matched) with certainty, and make no commitment on the rest of the data fields. this approach enables very accurate alignment of multiple data records. experimental results using a large number of web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is able to segment data records, align and extract data from them very accurately.

citee title:mining the peanut gallery: opinion extraction and semantic classification of product reviews
citee abstract:the web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). we begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. the best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. when operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. but in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.

citee title:determining the semantic orientation of terms through gloss analysis
citee abstract:sentiment classification is a recent subdiscipline of text classification which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. it has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of ``subjective'' terms contained in text, i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. in this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms. the method is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of such terms, i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries, and on the use of the resulting term representations for semi-supervised term classification. the method we present outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard benchmarks for this task

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:identifying comparative sentences in text documents
citee abstract:this paper studies the problem of identifying comparative sentences in text documents. the problem is related to but quite different from sentiment/opinion sentence identification or classification. sentiment classification studies the problem of classifying a document or a sentence based on the subjective opinion of the author. an important application area of sentiment/opinion identification is business intelligence as a product manufacturer always wants to know consumers opinions on its products. comparisons on the other hand can be subjective or objective. furthermore, a comparison is not concerned with an object in isolation. instead, it compares the object with others. an example opinion sentence is the sound quality of cd player x is poor. an example comparative sentence is the sound quality of cd player x is not as good as that of cd player y. clearly, these two sentences give different information. their language constructs are quite different too. identifying comparative sentences is also useful in practice because direct comparisons are perhaps one of the most convincing ways of evaluation, which may even be more important than opinions on each individual object. this paper proposes to study the comparative sentence identification problem. it first categorizes comparative sentences into different types, and then presents a novel integrated pattern discovery and supervised learning approach to identifying comparative sentences from text documents. experiment results using three types of documents, news articles, consumer reviews of products, and internet forum postings, show a precision of 79% and recall of 81%. more detailed results are given in the paper

citer abstract:opinion retrieval is a document retrieval process, which requires documents to be retrieved and ranked according to their opinions about a query topic. a relevant document must satisfy two criteria: relevant to the query topic, and contains opinions about the query, no matter if they are positive or negative. in this paper, we describe an opinion retrieval algorithm. it has a traditional information retrieval (ir) component to find topic relevant documents from a document set, an opinion classification component to find documents having opinions from the results of the ir step, and a component to rank the documents based on their relevance to the query, and their degrees of having opinions about the query. we implemented the algorithm as a working system and tested it using trec 2006 blog track data in automatic title-only runs. our result showed 28% to 32% improvements in map score over the best automatic runs in this 2006 track. our result is also 13% higher than a state-of-art opinion retrieval system, which is tested on the same data set

citee title:learning subjective language
citee abstract:subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations. there are numerous natural language processing applications for which subjectivity analysis is relevant, including information extraction and text categorization. the goal of this work is learning subjective language from corpora. clues of subjectivity are generated and tested, including low-frequency words, collocations, and adjectives and verbs identified using distributional similarity. the features are also examined working together in concert. the features, generated from different data sets using different procedures, exhibit consistency in performance in that they all do better and worse on the same data sets. in addition, this article shows that the density of subjectivity clues in the surrounding context strongly affects how likely it is that a word is subjective, and it provides the results of an annotation study assessing the subjectivity of sentences with high-density features. finally, the clues are used to perform opinion piece recognition (a type of text categorization and genre detection) to demonstrate the utility of the knowledge acquired in this article.

citee title:the rhetorical parsing of unrestricted texts: a surface-based approach
citee abstract:coherent texts are not just simple sequences of clauses and sentences, but rather complex artifacts that have highly elaborate rhetorical structure. this paper explores the extent to which well-formed rhetorical structures can be automatically derived by means of surface-form-based algorithms. these algorithms identify discourse usages of cue phrases and break sentences into clauses, hypothesize rhetorical relations that hold among textual units, and produce valid rhetorical structure trees for unrestricted natural language texts. the algorithms are empirically grounded in a corpus analysis of cue phrases and rely on a first-order formalization of rhetorical structure trees.the algorithms are evaluated both intrinsically and extrinsically. the intrinsic evaluation assesses the resemblance between automatically and manually constructed rhetorical structure trees. the extrinsic evaluation shows that automatically derived rhetorical structures can be successfully exploited in the context of text summarization

citee title:sentiment analysis using support vector machines with diverse information sources
citee abstract:this paper introduces an approach to sentiment analysis which uses support vector machines (svms) to bring together diverse sources of potentially pertinent information, including several favorability measures for phrases and adjectives and, where available, knowledge of the topic of the text. models using the features introduced are further combined with unigram models which have been shown to be effective in the past (pang et al., 2002) and lemmatized versions of the unigram models. experiments on movie review data from the internet movie database demonstrate that hybrid svms which combine unigram-style feature-based svms with those based on real-valued favorability measures obtain superior performance, producing the best results yet published using this data. further experiments using a feature set enriched with topic information on a smaller dataset of music reviews hand-annotated for topic are also reported, the results of which suggest that incorporating topic information into such models may also yield improvement.

citee abstract:this paper illustrates a sentiment analysis approach to extract sentiments associated with polarities of positive or negative for specific subjects from a document, instead of classifying the whole document into positive or negative.the essential issues in sentiment analysis are to identify how sentiments are expressed in texts and whether the expressions indicate positive (favorable) or negative (unfavorable) opinions toward the subject. in order to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, it is important to properly identify the semantic relationships between the sentiment expressions and the subject. by applying semantic analysis with a syntactic parser and sentiment lexicon, our prototype system achieved high precision (75-95%, depending on the data) in finding sentiments within web pages and news articles.

citee title:fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization
citee abstract:this chapter describes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: sequential minimal optimization, or smo. training a support vector machine (svm) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (qp) optimization problem. smo breaks this large qp problem into a series of smallest possible qp problems. these small qp problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical qp optimization as an inner loop. the amount of memory required for smo is linear in the training set size, which allows smo to handle very large training sets. because large matrix computation is avoided, smo scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (pcg) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. smo's computation time is dominated by svm evaluation, hence smo is fastest for linear svms and sparse data sets. for the mnist database, smo is as fast as pcg chunking; while for the uci adult database and linear svms, smo can be more than 1000 times faster than the pcg chunking algorithm.

surrounding text:the other main approach (semantic orientation) classifies words (usually automatically) into two classes, good and bad, and then computes an overall good/bad score for the text, however, such approaches miss important aspects of the task.  first, a more detailed semantic analysis of attitude expressions is needed, in the form of a well-designed taxonomy of attitude types and other semantic properties (as noted by taboada and grieve [***]<2>).  second, the atomic units of such expressions are not individual words, but rather appraisal groups: coherent groups of words that express together a particular attitude, such as extremely boring, or not really very good. from this perspective, most previous sentiment classification research has focused exclusively upon orientation, with attitude type addressed only indirectly, through the use of bag-of-words features.  an exception is taboada and grieves [***]<2> method of automatically determining top-level attitude types via application of of turneys pmi method [19]<2>.  they observed that different types of reviews contain different amounts of each attitude-type

citee abstract:the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. it makes two contributions. first, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented. the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. for a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. for a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews. such features form the basis for the above comparison. experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.

citee title:a sentimental education: sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts

citee abstract:we address the rating-inference problem, wherein rather than simply decide whether a review is "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", as in previous sentiment analysis work, one must determine an author's evaluation with respect to a multi-point scale (e.g., one to five "stars"). this task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, "three stars" is intuitively closer to "four stars" than to "one star".   we first evaluate human performance at the task. then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. we show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of svms when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.

citee title:towards answering opinion questions: separating facts from opinions and identifying the polarity of opinion sentences
citee abstract:opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing. in this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. we present a bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. we also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citee title:fast statistical spam filter by approximate classifications
citee abstract:statistical-based bayesian filters have become a popular and important defense against spam. however, despite their effectiveness, their greater processing overhead can prevent them from scaling well for enterprise-level mail servers. for example, the dictionary lookups that are characteristic of this approach are limited by the memory access rate, therefore relatively insensitive to increases in cpu speed. we address this scaling issue by proposing an acceleration technique that speeds up bayesian filters based on approximate classification. the approximation uses two methods: hash-based lookup and lossy encoding. lookup approximation is based on the popular bloom filter data structure with an extension to support value retrieval. lossy encoding is used to further compress the data structure. while both methods introduce additional errors to a strict bayesian approach, we show how the errors can be both minimized and biased toward a false negative classification.we demonstrate a 6x speedup over two well-known spam filters (bogofilter and qsf) while achieving an identical false positive rate and similar false negative rate to the original filters.

citee title:a mixture model for contextual text mining
citee abstract:contextual text mining is concerned with extracting topical themes from a text collection with context information (e.g., time and location) and comparing/analyzing the variations of themes over different contexts. since the topics covered in a document are usually related to the context of the document, analyzing topical themes within context can potentially reveal many interesting theme patterns. in this paper, we generalize some of these models proposed in the previous work and we propose a new general probabilistic model for contextual text mining that can cover several existing models as special cases. specifically, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (plsa) model by introducing context variables to model the context of a document. the proposed mixture model, called contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis (cplsa) model, can be applied to many interesting mining tasks, such as temporal text mining, spatiotemporal text mining, author-topic analysis, and cross-collection comparative analysis. empirical experiments show that the proposed mixture model can discover themes and their contextual variations effectively

citee abstract:pseudo-relevance feedback has proven to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval accuracy in all retrieval models. however the performance of existing pseudo feedback methods is often affected significantly by some parameters, such as the number of feedback documents to use and the relative weight of original query terms; these parameters generally have to be set by trial-and-error without any guidance. in this paper, we present a more robust method for pseudo feedback based on statistical language models. our main idea is to integrate the original query with feedback documents in a single probabilistic mixture model and regularize the estimation of the language model parameters in the model so that the information in the feedback documents can be gradually added to the original query. unlike most existing feedback methods, our new method has no parameter to tune. experiment results on two representative data sets show that the new method is significantly more robust than a state-of-the-art baseline language modeling approach for feedback with comparable or better retrieval accuracy.

citee title:mining the peanut gallery: opinion extraction and semantic classification of product reviews
citee abstract:the web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). we begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. the best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. when operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. but in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.

citee title:mining and summarizing customer reviews
citee abstract:merchants selling products on the web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. for a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. for the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. in this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques

citer abstract:in this paper, we describe a new model for collaborative filtering. the motivation of this work comes from the fact that two users with very similar preferences on items may have very different rating schemes. for example, one user may tend to assign a higher rating to all items than another user. unlike previous models of collaborative filtering, which determine the similarity between two users only based on their rating performance, our model treats the users preferences on items separately from the users rating scheme. more specifically, for each user, we build two separate models: a preference model capturing which items are favored by the user and a rating model capturing how the user would rate an item given the preference information. the similarity of two users is computed based on the underlying preference model, instead of the surface ratings. we compare the new model with several representative previous approaches on two data sets. experiment results show that the new model outperforms all the previous approaches that are tested consistently on both data sets

citee title:empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

many algorithms have been proposed to deal with the collaborative filtering problem [***, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12].  according to [***], most collaborative filtering algorithms can be categorized into two classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms.  the memory-based algorithms first find the users from the training database that are most similar to the current test user in terms of the rating pattern, and then combine the ratings given by those similar users to obtain the prediction for the test user - the memory-based algorithms first find the users from the training database that are most similar to the current test user in terms of the rating pattern, and then combine the ratings given by those similar users to obtain the prediction for the test user.  the major approaches within this category are the pearsoncorrelation based approach [4], the vector similarity based approach [***], and the extended generalized vector space model [3].  model-based approaches group together different users in the training database into a small number of classes based on their rating patterns - in order to predict the rating of a test user on a particular item, we can simply categorize the test user into one of the predefined user classes and use the predicted class as the prediction for the test user.  proposed algorithms within this category include a bayesian network approach [***], and the aspect model [5].  compared with the memory-based approaches, the model-based approaches only have to store the profiles of models and therefore are much more efficient than storing the whole user database - furthermore, model-based approaches tend to assume that a small number of user classes is sufficient for modeling the rating patterns of users, thus imply a loss of diversity among users, which may be very important in helping predict the ratings of a test user.  indeed, according to the previous studies on the comparison of memory-based approaches and model-based approaches, memory-based approaches such as the correlation method performs very close to those complicated model-based methods such as a bayesian network approach and an aspect model [***].  because both memory-based and model-based models permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page - special treatments are needed to deal with the missing ratings.  for example, in the correlation approach, default ratings are introduced for those unrated items [***].  for some probabilistic models, an extra rating category named norating is introduced in the case when ratings are missing [***] - for example, in the correlation approach, default ratings are introduced for those unrated items [***].  for some probabilistic models, an extra rating category named norating is introduced in the case when ratings are missing [***].  the second issue arose out of the observation that users with similar preferences on items may still rate items differently - the second issue arose out of the observation that users with similar preferences on items may still rate items differently.  indeed, in the previous study, the correlation approach usually outperforms the vector similarity approach significantly [***].  one major difference between these two approaches is that, for the correlation approach, the similarity (i$e$ the pearson correlation coefficients) between two users are measured based on the relative ratings, namely the original ratings subtracted by the average rating of each user, while for vector similarity approach, the original ratings are used for measuring the user similarity - one major difference between these two approaches is that, for the correlation approach, the similarity (i$e$ the pearson correlation coefficients) between two users are measured based on the relative ratings, namely the original ratings subtracted by the average rating of each user, while for vector similarity approach, the original ratings are used for measuring the user similarity.  in the comparison of these two approaches in [***], the correlation method outperforms the vector similarity method significantly, particularly in terms of the mse metric.  this fact indicates that, due to the variance in the rating behavior of different users, the rating information may not be able to indicate the preference information directly -

citer abstract:memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems, although these approaches all suffer from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. this paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. first, we use the enhanced pearson correlation coefficient (pcc) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. in this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. we also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. finally, empirical studies on dataset movielens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other stateofthe-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity

[***, 4] unified collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which achieved significant improvements over the standard approaches.  at the same time, in order to solve the data sparsity problem, researchers proposed dimensionality reduction approaches in [15] - ra,i is the rate user a gave item i, and ra represents the average rate of user a.  from this definition, user similarity sim(a, u) is ranging from [0, ***], and a larger value means users a and u are more similar.  item-based methods such as [5, 17] are similar to userbased approaches, and the difference is that item-based methods employ the similarity between the items instead of users - ru,i is the rate user u gave item i, and ri represents the average rate of item i.  like user similarity, item similarity sim(i, j) is also ranging from [0, ***].  3 - we use the following equation to solve this problem: sim(a, u) = min(ia  iu, )  e sim(a, u), (4) where ia  iu is the number of items which user a and user u rated in common.  this change bounds the similarity sim(a, u) to the interval [0, ***].  then the similarity between items could be defined as: sim(i, j) = min(ui  uj , )  e sim(i, j), (5) where ui  uj  is the number of users who rated both item i and item j - ) ~ (i + fi iks(i) sim(ik, i) e (ru,ik .  ik) fi iks(i) sim(ik, i) ), (8) where  is the parameter in the range of [0, ***].  the use of parameter  allows us to determine how the prediction relies on user-based prediction and item-based prediction - 8.  references [***] j.  basilico and t

citer abstract:memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems, although these approaches all suffer from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. this paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. first, we use the enhanced pearson correlation coefficient (pcc) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. in this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. we also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. finally, empirical studies on dataset movielens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other stateofthe-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity

citee title:empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

citee title:collaborative filtering with privacy via factor analysis
citee abstract:collaborative filtering (cf) is valuable in e-commerce, and for direct recommendations for music, movies, news etc. but today's systems have several disadvantages, including privacy risks. as we move toward ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. in this paper we describe a new method for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy of individual data. the method is based on a probabilistic factor analysis model. privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. the factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring default values for them. we give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for cf to date. the new algorithm has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms. finally, we suggest applications of the approach to other kinds of statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data.

citee title:item-based top-n recommendation
citee abstract:the explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. user-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. to address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. these techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.in this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. the key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality

citee title:an empirical analysis of design choices in neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithms
citee abstract:collaborative filtering systems predict a user's interest in new items based on the recommendations of other people with similar interests. instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. for these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. this article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. we apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component. the three components identified are similarity computation, neighbor selection, and rating combination.

citee title:an automatic weighting scheme for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. the memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. in these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. the impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. for example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. in this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. more specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.

citee abstract:the growth of internet commerce has stimulated the use of collaborative filtering (cf) algorithms as recommender systems. such systems leverage knowledge about the known preferences of multiple users to recommend items of interest to other users. cf methods have been harnessed to make recommendations about such items as web pages, movies, books, and toys. researchers have proposed and evaluated many approaches for generating recommendations. we describe and evaluate a new method called personality diagnosis (pd). given a users preferences for some items, we compute the probability that he or she is of the same personality type as other users, and, in turn, the probability that he or she will like new items. pd retains some of the advantages of traditional similarity-weighting techniques in that all data is brought to bear on each prediction and new data can be added easily and incrementally. additionally, pd has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation, which may be leveraged to justify, explain, and augment results. we report empirical results on the eachmovie database of movie ratings, and on user profile data collected from the citeseer digital library of computer science research papers. the probabilistic framework naturally supports a variety of descriptive measurementsin particular, we consider the applicability of a value of information (voi) computation.

citee abstract:memory-based methods for collaborative filtering predict new ratings by averaging (weighted) ratings between, respectively, pairs of similar users or items. in practice, a large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available, due to the sparsity inherent to rating data. consequently, prediction quality can be poor. this paper reformulates the memory-based collaborative filtering problem in a generative probabilistic framework, treating individual user-item ratings as predictors of missing ratings. the final rating is estimated by fusing predictions from three sources: predictions based on ratings of the same item by other users, predictions based on different item ratings made by the same user, and, third, ratings predicted based on data from other but similar users rating other but similar items. existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to the two simple cases of our framework. the complete model is however more robust to data sparsity, because the different types of ratings are used in concert, while additional ratings from similar users towards similar items are employed as a background model to smooth the predictions. experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are indeed more robust against data sparsity and give better recommendations.

citer abstract:recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. these systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the web. the tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. these are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. in traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. to address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. item-based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between di erent items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. in this paper we analyze di erent item-based recommendation generation algorithms. we look into di erent techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and di erent techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available userbased algorithms

citee title:learning collaborative information filters
citee abstract:predicting items a user would like on the basis of other users ratings for these items has become a well-established strategy adopted by many recommendation services on the internet. although this can be seen as a classification problem, algorithms proposed thus far do not draw on results from the machine learning literature. we propose a representation for collaborative filtering tasks that allows the application of virtually any machine learning algorithm. we identify the shortcomings of current collaborative filtering techniques and propose the use of learning algorithms paired with feature extraction techniques that specifically address the limitations of previous approaches. our best-performing algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition of an initial matrix of user ratings, exploiting latent structure that essentially eliminates the need for users to rate common items in order to become predictors for one another's preferences. we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a large database of user ratings for motion pictures and find that our approach significantly outperforms current collaborative filtering algorithms.

citee title:empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.
surrounding text:the model can be built o -line over a matter of hours or days.  the resulting model is very small, very fast, and essentially as accurate as nearest neighbor methods [***].  bayesian networks may prove practical for environments in which knowledge of user preferences changes slowly with respect to the time needed to build the model but are not suitable for environments in which user preference models must be updated rapidly or frequently - the prediction is then an average across the clusters, weighted by degree of participation.  clustering techniques usually produce less-personal recommendations than other methods, and in some cases, the clusters have worse accuracy than nearest neighbor algorithms [***].  once the clustering is complete, however, performance can be very good, since the size of the group that must be analyzed is much smaller - each individual ratings is within a numerical scale and it can as well be 0 indicating that the user has not yet rated that item.  researchers have devised a number of collaborative filtering algorithms that can be divided into two main categoriesmemory-based (user-based) and model-based (item-based) algorithms [***].  in this section we provide a detailed analysis of cf-based recommender system algorithms - the model building process is performed by di erent machine learning algorithms such as bayesian network, clustering, and rule-based approaches.  the bayesian network model [***] formulates a probabilistic model for collaborative filtering problem.  clustering model treats collaborative filtering as a classification problem [2, ***, 29] and works by clustering similar users in same class and estimating the probability that a particular user is in a particular class c, and from there computes the conditional probability of ratings - the bayesian network model [***] formulates a probabilistic model for collaborative filtering problem.  clustering model treats collaborative filtering as a classification problem [2, ***, 29] and works by clustering similar users in same class and estimating the probability that a particular user is in a particular class c, and from there computes the conditional probability of ratings.  the rule-based approach applies association rule discovery algorithms to find association between co-purchased items and then generates item recommendation based on the strength of the association between items [25] - , t in} top-n list of items for the active user output interface figure 1: the collaborative filtering process.  schemes have been proposed to compute the association between items ranging from probabilistic approach [***] to more traditional item-item correlations [15, 13].  we present a detailed analysis of our approach in the next section

citee title:combining collaborative filtering with personal agents for better recommendations
citee abstract:information filtering agents and collaborative filtering both attempt to alleviate information overload by identifying which items a user will find worthwhile. information filtering (if) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. collaborative filtering (cf) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined. this paper shows that a cf framework can be used to combine personal if agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. it also shows that using cf to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. one key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the cf framework select the best ones for them.

citer abstract:recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. these systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the web. the tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. these are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. in traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. to address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. item-based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between di erent items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. in this paper we analyze di erent item-based recommendation generation algorithms. we look into di erent techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and di erent techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available userbased algorithms

citee title:clustering methods for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:grouping people into clusters based on the items they have purchased allows accurate recommendations of new items for purchase: if you and i have liked many of the same movies, then i will probably enjoy other movies that you like. recommending items based on similarity of interest (a.k.a. collaborative filtering) is attractive for many domains: books, cds, movies, etc., but does not always work well. because data are always sparse { any given person has seen only a small fraction of all movies { much more accurate predictions can be made by grouping people into clusters with similar movies and grouping movies into clusters which tend to be liked by the same people. finding optimal clusters is tricky because the movie groups should be used to help determine the people groups and visa versa. we present a formal statistical model of collaborative filtering, and compare di erent algorithms for estimating the model parameters including variations of k-means clustering and gibbs sampling. this formal model is easily extended to handle clustering of objects with multiple attributes

citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

citee title:applying associative retrieval techniques to alleviate the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering
citee abstract:recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products, services, and information items to potential consumers. collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. a major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. in this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. we experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained leaky capacitor algorithm, a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. these algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the f-measure, and the rank score. we also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may "dilute" the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance

citer title:scalable collaborative filtering using cluster-based smoothing
citer abstract:memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. in the past, the memory-based approaches have been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems: data sparsity and difficulty in scalability. alternatively, the model-based approaches have been proposed to alleviate these problems, but these approaches tends to limit the range of users. in this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of these two kinds of approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method. in our approach, clusters generated from the training data provide the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection. as a result, we provide higher accuracy as well as increased efficiency in recommendations. empirical studies on two datasets (eachmovie and movielens) show that our new proposed approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms

citee title:clustering methods for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:grouping people into clusters based on the items they have purchased allows accurate recommendations of new items for purchase: if you and i have liked many of the same movies, then i will probably enjoy other movies that you like. recommending items based on similarity of interest (a.k.a. collaborative filtering) is attractive for many domains: books, cds, movies, etc., but does not always work well. because data are always sparse { any given person has seen only a small fraction of all movies { much more accurate predictions can be made by grouping people into clusters with similar movies and grouping movies into clusters which tend to be liked by the same people. finding optimal clusters is tricky because the movie groups should be used to help determine the people groups and visa versa. we present a formal statistical model of collaborative filtering, and compare di erent algorithms for estimating the model parameters including variations of k-means clustering and gibbs sampling. this formal model is easily extended to handle clustering of objects with multiple attributes

citee title:empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.
surrounding text:besides avoiding the need for collecting extensive information about items or users, cf requires no domain knowledge and can be easily adopted in different recommender systems.  collaborative filtering is usually adopted in two classes of application scenarios[***].  in the first class, a user is presented with one individual item at a time along with a predicted rating indicating the users potential interest in the item - a crucial component of the user-based model is the user-user similarity su,v that is used to select the set of neighbors.  popular choices for su,v include the pearson correlation coefficient( pcc)[22, 11]and the vector similarity(vs)[***].  one difficulty in measuring the user-user similarity is that the raw ratings may contain biases caused by the different rating behaviors of different users - to correct such biases, different methods have been proposed to normalize or center the data prior to measuring user similarities.

citee abstract:collaborative filtering systems predict a user's interest in new items based on the recommendations of other people with similar interests. instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. for these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. this article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. we apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component. the three components identified are similarity computation, neighbor selection, and rating combination.

citee title:cumulated gain-based evaluation of ir techniques
citee abstract:modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. in order to develop ir techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit ir methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. this can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. this article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. the first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. the second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. the third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of ir techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. these novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using trec data: sample system run results for 20 queries in trec-7. as a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. the test results indicate that the proposed measures credit ir methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. the graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance ir techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.
surrounding text:commonly used measures for accuracy include the mean absolute error (mae) and the root mean square error (rmse), both of which depend on difference between true rating and predicted rating.  however, since the emphasis of our work is on improving item rankings instead of rating prediction, we employ the normalized discounted cumulative gain(ndcg)[***] metric, which is an increasingly popular metric for evaluating ranked results in information retrieval where the documents are assigned graded rather than binary relevance judgements.  for collaborative filtering applications, the ratings on items assigned by the users can naturally serve as the graded relevance judgements

citee abstract:recent web search techniques augment traditional text matching with a global notion of ``importance'' based on the linkage structure of the web, such as in google's pagerank algorithm. for more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance--for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. we present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. we present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques.

citee abstract:in this paper, we describe a new model for collaborative filtering. the motivation of this work comes from the fact that two users with very similar preferences on items may have very different rating schemes. for example, one user may tend to assign a higher rating to all items than another user. unlike previous models of collaborative filtering, which determine the similarity between two users only based on their rating performance, our model treats the users preferences on items separately from the users rating scheme. more specifically, for each user, we build two separate models: a preference model capturing which items are favored by the user and a rating model capturing how the user would rate an item given the preference information. the similarity of two users is computed based on the underlying preference model, instead of the surface ratings. we compare the new model with several representative previous approaches on two data sets. experiment results show that the new model outperforms all the previous approaches that are tested consistently on both data sets

citee title:optimizing search engines using clickthrough data
citee abstract:this paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. while previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. this makes them difficult and expensive to apply. the goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. taking a support vector machine (svm) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. from a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. the theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. it shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples
surrounding text:most of the proposed methods are dedicated to ranking items represented in some feature space as is the setting for content-based filtering.  given a set of ordered pairs of instances as training data, the different methods either try to learn an item scoring function[4, ***] or learn a classifier for classifying item pairs into two types of relations(correctly ordered vs.  incorrectly ordered)[5, 6] - incorrectly ordered)[5, 6].  different machine learning models including svm, boosting and neural network have been used for learning such ranking functions, which led to methods such as ranking svm[***], ranknet[4] and rankboost[6].  3 - in content-based filtering, the preference function 	 is often realized by a binary classifier that categorizes each pair of items into two categories(correctly ranked and incorrectly ranked) based on their content features.  various machine learning approaches including ensembles[5, 6], support vector machines[***] and neural networks[4] have been developed for learning such a binary classifier to model the preference function.  however, in the collaborative filtering setting, such approaches could not be applied due to the lack of features for describing the items

citee title:placing search in context: the concept revisited
citee abstract:keyword-based search engines are in widespread use today as a popular means for web-based information retrieval. although such systems seem deceptively simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial information needs. this paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. this paradigm is implemented in practice in the intellizap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document ("the context"). the context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. the latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. search results are then semantically reranked, using context. experimental results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the web.
surrounding text:in the second scenario, we assume the user is viewing a document (for instance, browsing the web or reading email), and selects a term from the document for which he would like more information.  this notion of search in context is discussed in [***].  for instance, if a query for \architecture" is performed by highlighting a term in a document discussing famous building architects, we would like the result to be di erent than if the query \architecture" is performed by highlighting a term in a document on cpu design

citee title:scaling personalized web search
citee abstract:recent web search techniques augment traditional text matching with a global notion of ``importance'' based on the linkage structure of the web, such as in google's pagerank algorithm. for more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance--for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. we present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. we present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques.

citee abstract:the pagerank algorithm, used in the google search engine, greatly improves the results of web search by taking into account the link structure of the web. pagerank assigns to a page a score proportional to the number of times a random surfer would visit that page, if it surfed indefinitely from page to page, following all outlinks from a page with equal probability. we propose to improve pagerank by using a more intelligent surfer, one that is guided by a probabilistic model of the relevance of a page to a query. efficient execution of our algorithm at query time is made possible by precomputing at crawl time (and thus once for all queries) the necessary terms. experiments on two large subsets of the web indicate that our algorithm significantly outperforms pagerank in the (humanrated) quality of the pages returned, while remaining efficient enough to be used in todays large search engines.

citee title:search engines for the world wide web: a comparative study and evaluation methodology
citee abstract:three web search engines, namely, alta vista, excite, and lycos, were compared and evaluated in terms of their search capabilities (e.g., boolean logic, truncation, field search, word and phrase search) and retrieval performances (i.e., precision and response time) using sample queries drawn from real reference questions. recall, the other evaluation criterion of information retrieval, is deliberately omitted from this study because it is impossible to assume how many relevant items there are for a particular query in the huge and ever changing web system. the authors of this study found that alta vista outperformed excite and lycos in both search facilities and retrieval performance although lycos had the largest coverage of web resources among the three web search engines examined. as a result of this research, we also proposed a methodology for evaluating other web search engines not included in the current study.

citee title:authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment
citee abstract:the network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have eective means for understanding it. we develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their eectiveness in a variety of contexts on the world wide web. the central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of \authoritative" information sources on such topics. we propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of \hub pages" that join them together in the link structure. our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.
surrounding text:if a is seen to point to a lot of good documents, then a's opinion becomes more valuable, and the fact that a points to b would suggest that b is a good document as well.  using this basic idea, kleinberg [***] developed a connectivity analysis algorithm for hyperlinked environments.  given an initial set of results from a search service, the algorithm extracts a subgraph from the web containing the result set and its neighboring documents - 2 connectivity analysis the goal of connectivity analysis is to exploit linkage information between documents, based on the assumption that a link between two documents implies that the documents contain related content (assumption i), and that if the documents were authored by di erent people then the first author found the second document valuable (assumption ii).  in 1997 kleinberg [***] published an algorithm for connectivity analysis on the world wide web which we describe next.  2 - (4) while the vectors h and a have not converged: (5) for all n in n, a[n] :=p(n0;n)2n h[n0] (6) for all n in n, h[n] :=p(n;n0)2n a[n0] (7) normalize the h and a vectors.  kleinberg [***] proved that the h and a vectors will eventually converge, i. e - note that the algorithm does not claim to find all relevant pages, since there may be some that have good content but have not been linked to by many authors.  in our evaluation of di erent algorithms we use kleinberg's algorithm [***] as our baseline, which we call base.  2 - one way of obtaining inlinks is to use altavista queries of the form link : u, which returns a list of documents that point to the url u.  this was the implementation used by [***].  in our queries, the neighborhood graph contained on the order of 2000 nodes

citee title:web page cleaning for web mining through feature weighting
citee abstract:unlike conventional data or text, web pages typically contain a large amount of information that is not part of the main contents of the pages, e.g., banner ads, navigation bars, and copyright notices. such irrelevant information (which we call web page noise) in web pages can seriously harm web mining, e.g., clustering and classification. in this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting technique to deal with web page noise to enhance web mining. this method first builds a compressed structure tree to capture the common structure and comparable blocks in a set of web pages. it then uses an information based measure to evaluate the importance of each node in the compressed structure tree. based on the tree and its node importance values, our method assigns a weight to each word feature in its content block. the resulting weights are used in web mining. we evaluated the proposed technique with two web mining tasks, web page clustering and web page classification. experimental results show that our weighting method is able to dramatically improve the mining results.

citer title:learning block importance models for web pages
citer abstract:some previous works show that a web page can be partitioned to multiple segments or blocks, and usually the importance of those blocks in a page is not equivalent. also, it is proved that differentiating noisy or unimportant blocks from pages can facilitate web mining, search and accessibility. but in these works, no uniform approach or model is presented to measure the importance of different portions in web pages. through a user study, we found that people do have a consistent view about the importance of blocks in web pages. in this paper, we investigate how to find a model to automatically assign importance values to blocks in a web page. we define the block importance estimation as a learning problem. first, we use the vips (vision-based page segmentation) algorithm to partition a web page into semantic blocks with a hierarchy structure. then spatial features (such as position, size) and content features (such as the number of images and links) are extracted to construct a feature vector for each block. based on these features, learning algorithms, such as svm and neural network, are applied to train various block importance models. in our experiments, the best model can achieve the performance with micro-f1 79% and micro-accuracy 85.9%, which is quite close to a persons

citee title:eliminating noisy information in web pages for data mining
citee abstract:a commercial web page typically contains many information blocks. apart from the main content blocks, it usually has such blocks as navigation panels, copyright and privacy notices, and advertisements (for business purposes and for easy user access). we call these blocks that are not the main content blocks of the page the noisy blocks. we show that the information contained in these noisy blocks can seriously harm web data mining. eliminating these noises is thus of great importance. in this paper, we propose a noise elimination technique based on the following observation: in a given web site, noisy blocks usually share some common contents and presentation styles, while the main content blocks of the pages are often diverse in their actual contents and/or presentation styles. based on this observation, we propose a tree structure, called style tree, to capture the common presentation styles and the actual contents of the pages in a given web site. by sampling the pages of the site, a style tree can be built for the site, which we call the site style tree (sst). we then introduce an information based measure to determine which parts of the sst represent noises and which parts represent the main contents of the site. the sst is employed to detect and eliminate noises in any web page of the site by mapping this page to the sst. the proposed technique is evaluated with two data mining tasks, web page clustering and classification. experimental results show that our noise elimination technique is able to improve the mining results significantly

citee abstract:in contrast to traditional document retrieval, a web page as a whole is not a good information unit to search because it often contains multiple topics and a lot of irrelevant information from navigation, decoration, and interaction part of the page. in this paper, we propose a vision-based page segmentation (vips) algorithm to detect the semantic content structure in a web page. compared with simple dom based segmentation method, our page segmentation scheme utilizes useful visual cues to obtain a better partition of a page at the semantic level. by using our vips algorithm to assist the selection of query expansion terms in pseudo-relevance feedback in web information retrieval, we achieve 27% performance improvement on web track dataset
surrounding text:there are several kinds of methods for web page segmentation.  most popular ones are dom-based segmentation [4], location-based segmentation [9] and vision-based page segmentation (vips) [***][3].  these methods distinguish each other by considering various factors as the partition basis

citer abstract:web link analysis has proven to be a significant enhancement for quality based web search. most existing links can be classified into two categories: intra-type links (e.g., web hyperlinks), which represent the relationship of data objects within a homogeneous data type (web pages), and inter-type links (e.g., user browsing log) which represent the relationship of data objects across different data types (users and web pages). unfortunately, most link analysis research only considers one type of link. in this paper, we propose a unified link analysis framework, called link fusion, which considers both the inter- and intra- type link structure among multiple-type inter-related data objects and brings order to objects in each data type at the same time. the pagerank and hits algorithms are shown to be special cases of our unified link analysis framework. experiments on an instantiation of the framework that makes use of the user data and web pages extracted from a proxy log show that our proposed algorithm could improve the search effectiveness over the hits and directhit algorithms by 24.6% and 38.2% respectively

citee abstract:this paper addresses the problem of topic distillation on theworld wideweb, namely, given a typical user query to find quality documents related to the query topic. connectivity analysis has been shown to be useful in identifying high quality pages within a topic specific graph of hyperlinked documents. the essence of our approach is to augment a previous connectivity analysis based algorithm with content analysis. we identify three problems with the existing approach and devise algorithms to tackle them. the results of a user evaluation are reported that show an improvement of precision at 10 documents by at least 45% over pure connectivity analysis
surrounding text:with such huge volume and great variation in contents, finding useful information effectively from the web becomes a very challenging job.  traditional keyword based text search engines cannot provide satisfying results to web queries since: (1) users tend to submit very short, sometime ambiguous queries and they are reluctant to provide feedback information [***].  (2) the quality of web pages varies greatly [6], and users usually prefer high quality pages over low quality pages in the result set returned by the search engine - =+ (3) there are two issues that need to be considered in eq.  (3): first, as noted by bharat and henzinger [***], mutually reinforcing relationships between objects may give undue weight to objects.  ideally, we would like all the objects to have the same influence on the other objects they connect to - then, the root set is expanded to the base set by its neighborhoods, which are the web pages that either point to or are pointed at by pages in the root set.  in this experiment, we set the maximum in-degree of nodes as 50, which is commonly adopted by the previous works [***, 17].  the expanded set of web pages forms the data objects in hub space and authority space

citee title:the anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine
citee abstract:in this paper, we present google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. google is designed to crawl and index the web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. the prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/         to engineer a search engine is a challenging task. search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. they answer tens of millions of queries every day. despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. this paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.         apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. this paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want
surrounding text:most existing web related research fits into the web multi-space model we described in figure 1.  for example, web search [***, 17] uses the web page space and hyperlinks within the space; collaborate filtering [14] uses the document (web page) space, the user space, and the browsing relationship in-between; web query clustering [22] uses the web page space, query space, and reference relationship in-between.  unfortunately, most of these works only consider one type of link/relationship when analyzing the links/relationships of objects, and they can be classified into intra-type link analysis and inter-type link analysis regarding the type of links they use - in intra-type link analysis, the attribute of a data object is directly reinforced by the same attribute of other data objects in the same data space.  for example, in googles pagerank algorithm [***], the popularity attributes of web pages are reinforcing each other via the hyper-link structure within them.  in inter-type link analysis, the attribute of one type of data objects is reinforced by attributes of data objects from other data spaces - it is easy to find out that w is the principle eigenvector of a.  following the same rationale, brin and page [***] design the pagerank algorithm to calculate the importance of web pages in the web.  in addition to pinski and narins algorithm, pagerank simulates a web surfers behavior on the web

citee abstract:the web is a hypertext body of approximately 300 million pages that continues to grow at roughly a million pages per day. page variation is more prodigious than the data's raw scale: taken as a whole, the set of web pages lacks a unifying structure and shows far more authoring style and content variation than that seen in traditional text-document collections. this level of complexity makes an "off-the-shelf" database-management and information-retrieval solution impossible. to date, index-based search engines for the web have been the primary tool by which users search for information. such engines can build giant indices that let you quickly retrieve the set of all web pages containing a given word or string. experienced users can make effective use of such engines for tasks that can be solved by searching for tightly constrained keywords and phrases. these search engines are, however, unsuited for a wide range of equally important tasks. in particular, a topic of any breadth will typically contain several thousand or million relevant web pages. how then, from this sea of pages, should a search engine select the correct ones-those of most value to the user?

citer abstract:web link analysis has proven to be a significant enhancement for quality based web search. most existing links can be classified into two categories: intra-type links (e.g., web hyperlinks), which represent the relationship of data objects within a homogeneous data type (web pages), and inter-type links (e.g., user browsing log) which represent the relationship of data objects across different data types (users and web pages). unfortunately, most link analysis research only considers one type of link. in this paper, we propose a unified link analysis framework, called link fusion, which considers both the inter- and intra- type link structure among multiple-type inter-related data objects and brings order to objects in each data type at the same time. the pagerank and hits algorithms are shown to be special cases of our unified link analysis framework. experiments on an instantiation of the framework that makes use of the user data and web pages extracted from a proxy log show that our proposed algorithm could improve the search effectiveness over the hits and directhit algorithms by 24.6% and 38.2% respectively

citee title:authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment
citee abstract:the network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have eective means for understanding it. we develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their eectiveness in a variety of contexts on the world wide web. the central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of \authoritative" information sources on such topics. we propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of \hub pages" that join them together in the link structure. our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.
surrounding text:based on the observations above, researchers tried different approaches to improve the effectiveness of web search engines.  one of the representative solutions is re-ranking the top retrieved web pages by their importance [1, 11, ***], which is calculated by analyzing the hyperlinks among web pages.  hyperlink analysis (such as [1, 3-7, 17-19]) has been shown to achieve much better performance than full text search, in production systems - most existing web related research fits into the web multi-space model we described in figure 1.  for example, web search [4, ***] uses the web page space and hyperlinks within the space; collaborate filtering [14] uses the document (web page) space, the user space, and the browsing relationship in-between; web query clustering [22] uses the web page space, query space, and reference relationship in-between.  unfortunately, most of these works only consider one type of link/relationship when analyzing the links/relationships of objects, and they can be classified into intra-type link analysis and inter-type link analysis regarding the type of links they use - 6% and 38. 2% compared to the traditional hits [***] and directhit [11] algorithms, respectively.  browse issue reference user query web-page the rest of this paper is organized as follows - 1/u=((+. ij n w 1))tumwŦ= kleinberg [***] claimed that web pages and scientific documents are governed by different principles.  journals have approximately the same purpose, and highly authoritative journals always refer to other authoritative journals - then, the root set is expanded to the base set by its neighborhoods, which are the web pages that either point to or are pointed at by pages in the root set.  in this experiment, we set the maximum in-degree of nodes as 50, which is commonly adopted by the previous works [3, ***].  the expanded set of web pages forms the data objects in hub space and authority space

citee title:discovering complex matchings across web query interfaces: a correlation mining approach
citee abstract:to enable information integration, schema matching is a critical step for discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sources. while complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. to tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the internet. on this "deep web," query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g.,  corresponds to  in the books domain). we observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., ) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. in contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. this insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach. in particular, we develop the dcm framework, which consists of data preparation, dual mining of positive and negative correlations, and finally matching selection. unlike previous correlation mining algorithms, which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations, our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations, especially the subtlety of negative correlations, due to its special importance in schema matching. this leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure, $h$-measure, distinct from those proposed in previous work. we evaluate our approach extensively and the results show good accuracy for discovering complex matchings

citee title:empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering
citee abstract:collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

citee abstract:collaborative filtering (cf) has become an important data mining technique to make personalized recommendations for books, web pages or movies, etc. one popular algorithm is the memory-based collaborative filtering, which predicts a users preference based on his or her similarity to other users (instances) in the database. however, the tremendous growth of users and the large number of products, memory-based cf algorithms results in the problem of deciding the right instances to use during prediction, in order to reduce executive cost and excessive storage, and possibly to improve the generalization accuracy by avoiding noise and overfitting. in this paper, we focus our work on a typical user preference database that contains many missing values, and propose four novel instance reduction techniques called turf1-turf4 as a preprocessing step to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the memory-based cf algorithm. the key idea is to generate prediction from a carefully selected set of relevant instances. we evaluate the techniques on the well-known eachmovie data set. our experiments showed that the proposed algorithms not just dramatically speed up the prediction, but also improved the accuracy.

citee title:knowledge discovery in large spatial databases: focusing techniques for efficient class identification
citee abstract:both, the number and the size of spatial databases are rapidly growing because of the large amount of data obtained from satellite images, x-ray crystallography or other scientific equipment. therefore, automated knowledge discovery becomes more and more important in spatial databases. so far, most of the methods for knowledge discovery in databases (kdd) have been based on relational database systems. in this paper, we address the task of class identification in spatial databases using clustering techniques. we put special emphasis on the integration of the discovery methods with the db interface, which is crucial for the efficiency of kdd on large databases. the key to this integration is the use of a well-known spatial access method, the r*-tree. the focusing component of a kdd system determines which parts of the database are relevant for the knowledge discovery task. we present several strategies for focusing: selecting representatives from a spatial database, focusing on the relevant clusters and retrieving all objects of a given cluster. we have applied the proposed techniques to real data from a large protein database used for predicting protein-protein docking. a performance evaluation on this database indicates that clustering on large spatial databases can be performed, both, efficiently and effectively. this research was funded by the german minister for research and technology (bmft) under grant no. 01 ib 307 b. the authors are responsible for the contents of this paper
