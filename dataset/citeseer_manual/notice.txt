Steps to collect experiment corpus.

1. Find paper cite or cited by papers listed in readme file.
For each field, 10 papers are enough.  
Please use high cited paper, more than 300 is good.

2. Parse them into txt format and annotate different sections(aspects).

3. I think we could extract their citation relationship by writing a script.  When collecting papers, please skip recording their citations relationship.
