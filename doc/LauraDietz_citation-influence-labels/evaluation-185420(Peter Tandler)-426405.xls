citingPub	426405	Shared environments beyond the desktop supporting face-to-face collaboration put new requirements on software: Users interact with multiple devices, and collaborate using different kinds of devices. The configuration of the devices is changing frequently due to the demands of new work practices in organizations which will be characterized by a high degree of dynamics, flexibility, and mobility. These are examples of requirements that have an impact on the architecture of the software infrastructure of these environments. BEACH, the software part of i--LAND (the ubiquitous computing environment at GMD-IPSI), uses an architecture designed to meet these requirements. It provides the functionality for synchronous cooperation and interaction with roomware components, i.e. room elements with integrated information technology. This paper discusses the software requirements for a roomware environment, and presents the architecture of BEACH. It closes with an overview of the current implement...<	Peter Tandler	Architecture of BEACH: The Software Infrastructure for Roomware Environments

xx	260090	"We are investigating how people move from individual to group work through the use of both personal digital  assistants (PDAs) and a shared public display. Our scenario  of this work covers the following activities. First, mobile  individuals can create ""personal"" notes on their PDAs.  Second, when individuals meet in real time, they can  selectively ""publicize"" notes by moving them to a shared  public display. Third, the group can manipulate personal  and public items in real time through both PDAs and the  shared public display, where the notes contained on both  PDAs and public display are automatically synchronized.  Finally, people leave a meeting with a common record of  their activity. We describe our SharedNotes system that  illustrates how people move through this scenario. We also  highlight a variety of problematic design issues that result  from having different devices and from having the system  enforce a rigid distinction between personal and public  information.

x	229556	A major difficulty in writing Single Display Groupware (co-present collaborative) applications is getting input from multiple devices. We introduce MID, a Java package that addresses this problem and offers an architecture to access advanced events through Java. In this paper, we describe the features, architecture and limitations of MID. We also briefly describe an application that uses MID to get input from multiple mice: KidPad. Keywords Single Display Groupware (SDG), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Multiple Input Devices (MID), Multi-Modal Input, Java, DirectInput, Windows 98, Universal Serial Bus (USB), KidPad, Jazz, Pad++. INTRODUCTION Communication, collaboration, and coordination are brought to many people's desktops thanks to groupware applications such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange, some of the leading commercial products in the field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). They help people collaborate when they are not in the same place at th...<	Benjamin B.

x	496265	"Our goal is to provide tools to support working meetings on an electronic whiteboard, called Tivoli. This paper de-  scribes how we have integrated structured ""domain objects""  into the whiteboard environment. Domain objects represent  the subject matter of meetings and can be exchanged between  Tivoli and group databases. Domain objects can be  tailored to produce meeting tools that are finely tuned to  meeting practices. We describe the facility for tailoring and  managing domain objects and the user interface techniques  for blending these into the whiteboard environment. We  show examples of both specific and generic meeting tools  crafted from domain objects, and we describe a long-term  case study in which these tools support an ongoing work  process."

xx	195548	This paper introduces COAST, an object-oriented toolkit for the development of synchronous groupware,  which enhances the usability and simplifies the  development of such applications. COAST offers basic  and generic components for the design of synchronous  groupware and is complemented by a methodology for  groupware development. Basic features of the toolkit  include transaction-controlled access to replicated  shared objects, transparent replication management,  and a fully optimistic concurrency control.  Development support is provided by a session concept  supporting the flexible coupling of shared objects'  aspects between concurrent users and by a fully  transparent updating concept for displays which is  based on declarative programming.  KEYWORDS: toolkit, synchronous collaboration,  groupware, replicated objects, sessions, display  updating, concurrency control  1 INTRODUCTION  Groupware allows several geographically distributed  people to work together with the aid of a computerized  envi...

x	181141	We introduce a model for supporting collaborative work between people that are physically close to each other. We call this model Single Display Groupware (SDG). In this paper, we describe this model, comparing it to more traditional remote  collaboration. We describe the requirements that SDG places on computer technology, and our understanding of the benefits  and costs of SDG systems. Finally, we describe a prototype SDG system that we built and the results of a usability test we  ran with 60 elementary school children.  Keywords  CSCW, Single Display Groupware, children, educational applications, input devices, Pad++, KidPad.  INTRODUCTION  In the early 1970's, researchers at Xerox PARC created an atmosphere in which they lived and worked with technology of the  future. When the world's first personal computer, the Alto, was invented, it had only a single keyboard and mouse. This  fundamental design legacy has carried through to nearly all modern computer systems. Although networks have...	Allison Druin, Benjamin B. Bederson, Jason Stewart	Single Display Groupware: A Model for Co-present Collaboration	
x	425378	"We describe the i-LAND environment which constitutes an example of our vision of the workspaces of the future, in this case supporting cooperative work of dynamic teams with changing needs. i-LAND requires and provides new forms of human-computer interaction and new forms of computer-supported cooperative work. Its design is based on an integration of information and architectural spaces, implications of new work practices and an empirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consists of several `roomware' components, i.e. computer-augmented objects integrating room elements with information technology. We present the current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhanced chairs, and two ""bridges"" for the Passage-mechanism. This is complemented by the description of the creativity support application and the technological infrastructure. The paper is accompanied by a video figure in the CHI'99 video program.<"	Christian Mller-tomfelde, Jrg Geiler, Norbert A. Streitz, Peter Seitz, Petra Rexroth, R.

x	431092	". In this paper, we introduce the concepts of ""cooperative buildings"" and ""roomware"" and place them in the context of the integrated design of real, physical,  resp. architectural spaces and virtual, resp. digital information spaces. By ""roomware  "" we mean computer-augmented things in rooms, like doors, walls, furniture,  and others. The general approach is detailed via examples from the i-LAND project  where we develop several ""roomware"" components in order to realize an interactive  information and cooperation landscape, e.g. an innovative work environment for  creativity teams. We describe the current realization of i-LAND which includes an  interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, computer-augmented chairs, and a  mechanism for assigning physical objects as representatives of information objects  in the virtual world.

x	176607	This paper describes DOLPHIN, a fully group aware application designed to provide computer support for  different types of meetings: face--to--face meetings with  a large interactive electronic whiteboard with or  without networked computers provided to the  participants, extensions of these meetings with remote  participants at their desktop computers connected via  computer and audio/video networks and/ or participants  in a second meeting room also provided with an  electronic whiteboard and networked computers.  DOLPHIN supports the creation and manipulation of  informal structures (e.g. free hand drawings,  handwritten scribbles) as well as formal structures (e.g.  hypermedia documents with typed nodes and links) and  their coexistence and transformation.
