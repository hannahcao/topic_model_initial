citingPub	425378	"We describe the i-LAND environment which constitutes an example of our vision of the workspaces of the future, in this case supporting cooperative work of dynamic teams with changing needs. i-LAND requires and provides new forms of human-computer interaction and new forms of computer-supported cooperative work. Its design is based on an integration of information and architectural spaces, implications of new work practices and an empirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consists of several `roomware' components, i.e. computer-augmented objects integrating room elements with information technology. We present the current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhanced chairs, and two ""bridges"" for the Passage-mechanism. This is complemented by the description of the creativity support application and the technological infrastructure. The paper is accompanied by a video figure in the CHI'99 video program.<"	Christian Mller-tomfelde, Jrg Geiler, Norbert A. Streitz, Peter Seitz, Petra Rexroth, R.

o	504544	"We introduce the concept of Graspable User Interfaces that allow direct control of electronic or virtual objects through  physical handles for control. These physical artifacts, which  we call ""bricks,"" are essentially new input devices that can  be tightly coupled or ""attached"" to virtual objects for  manipulation or for expressing action (e.g., to set parameters  or for initiating processes). Our bricks operate on top of a  large horizontal display surface known as the ""ActiveDesk.""  We present four stages in the development of Graspable UIs:  (1) a series of exploratory studies on hand gestures and  grasping; (2) interaction simulations using mock-ups and  rapid prototyping tools; (3) a working prototype and sample  application called GraspDraw; and (4) the initial integrating  of the Graspable UI concepts into a commercial application.  Finally, we conclude by presenting a design space for Bricks  which lay the foundation for further exploring and  developing Graspable User Interfaces."	George W.

o	239716	"This paper presents our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): ""Tangible Bits."" Tangible Bits allows  users to ""grasp &amp; manipulate"" bits in the center of users'  attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical  objects and architectural surfaces. Tangible Bits also  enables users to be aware of background bits at the  periphery of human perception using ambient display media  such as light, sound, airflow, and water movement in an  augmented space. The goal of Tangible Bits is to bridge  the gaps between both cyberspace and the physical  environment, as well as the foreground and background of  human activities.  This paper describes three key concepts of Tangible Bits:  interactive surfaces; the coupling of bits with graspable  physical objects; and ambient media for background  awareness. We illustrate these concepts with three  prototype systems -- the metaDESK, transBOARD and  ambientROOM -- to identify underlying research issues.  Keywords  tangible user interface, ambient media, gras..."	Brygg Ullmer, Hitoshi Ishii	Tangible Bits: Towards Seamless Interfaces between People, Bits and Atoms	
x	60252	Current user interface techniques such as WIMP or the desktop metaphor do not support real world tasks, because the  focus of these user interfaces is only on human--computer interactions,  not on human--real world interactions. In this paper,  we propose a method of building computer augmented  environments using a situation-aware portable device. This  device, called NaviCam, has the ability to recognize the user's  situation by detecting color-code IDs in real world environments.  It displays situation sensitive information by superimposing  messages on its video see-through screen. Combination  of ID-awareness and portable video-see-through display  solves several problems with current ubiquitous computers  systems and augmented reality systems.

o	195548	This paper introduces COAST, an object-oriented toolkit for the development of synchronous groupware,  which enhances the usability and simplifies the  development of such applications. COAST offers basic  and generic components for the design of synchronous  groupware and is complemented by a methodology for  groupware development. Basic features of the toolkit  include transaction-controlled access to replicated  shared objects, transparent replication management,  and a fully optimistic concurrency control.  Development support is provided by a session concept  supporting the flexible coupling of shared objects'  aspects between concurrent users and by a fully  transparent updating concept for displays which is  based on declarative programming.  KEYWORDS: toolkit, synchronous collaboration,  groupware, replicated objects, sessions, display  updating, concurrency control  1 INTRODUCTION  Groupware allows several geographically distributed  people to work together with the aid of a computerized  envi...

x	176607	This paper describes DOLPHIN, a fully group aware application designed to provide computer support for  different types of meetings: face--to--face meetings with  a large interactive electronic whiteboard with or  without networked computers provided to the  participants, extensions of these meetings with remote  participants at their desktop computers connected via  computer and audio/video networks and/ or participants  in a second meeting room also provided with an  electronic whiteboard and networked computers.  DOLPHIN supports the creation and manipulation of  informal structures (e.g. free hand drawings,  handwritten scribbles) as well as formal structures (e.g.  hypermedia documents with typed nodes and links) and  their coexistence and transformation.  KEYWORDS: electronic meeting rooms, document--  based cooperation, shared workspaces, collaborative  writing/drawing, brainstorming, planning, hypermedia,  pen--based interaction, interactive whiteboards  1 INTRODUCTION  Cooperation of people can ...

x	431092	". In this paper, we introduce the concepts of ""cooperative buildings"" and ""roomware"" and place them in the context of the integrated design of real, physical,  resp. architectural spaces and virtual, resp. digital information spaces. By ""roomware  "" we mean computer-augmented things in rooms, like doors, walls, furniture,  and others. The general approach is detailed via examples from the i-LAND project  where we develop several ""roomware"" components in order to realize an interactive  information and cooperation landscape, e.g. an innovative work environment for  creativity teams. We describe the current realization of i-LAND which includes an  interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, computer-augmented chairs, and a  mechanism for assigning physical objects as representatives of information objects  in the virtual world.
