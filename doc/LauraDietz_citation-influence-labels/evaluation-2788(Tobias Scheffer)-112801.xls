citingPub	112801	In image segmentation problems, there is usually a vast amount of filter operations available, a subset of which has to be selected and instantiated  in order to obtain a satisfactory segmentation procedure for a particular domain.  In supervised segmentation, a mapping from features, such as filter  outputs for individual pixels, to classes is induced automatically. However,  since the sample size required for supervised learning grows exponentially  in the number of features it is not feasible to learn a segmentation procedure  from a large amount of possible filters. But we argue that automatic model  selection methods are able to select a region model in terms of some filters.  This paper is printed in Proceedings of Workshop on Visual Information Processing, Sydney  1997, pp. 11-21  We propose a wrapper algorithm that performs this task. We present results  on artificial textured images (Brodatz) and report on our experiences with  x--ray images.  Keywords: model based image segmentation, ...

x	42995	Texture is one of the most informative visual cues that help us understand our environment. Texture analysis is an important step in many  visual tasks, such as scene segmentation, object recognition, and shape  and depth perception. In this chapter we consider the problem of texture  recognition and provide an overview of our recent work on this topic  ([21, 19, 18]). Our method is based on representing textures in frequency  and orientation space, and using non-parametric learning schemes for classification.  We present state-of-the-art recognition results on a 30 texture  database and compare the performance of a rule-based network, the  k-nearest neighbor and feedforward neural-network classifiers. An important  extension to the system allows for rotation invariance. Experimental  results are presented for large-database rotation-invariant natural texture  recognition.  1. Introduction  Textures in an image are usually very apparent to a human observer (for example  see Fig. 1), but no simple m...	Hayit Greenspan	Non-Parametric Texture Learning
x	356583	In the feature subset selection problem, a learning algorithm is faced with the problem of selecting a relevant subset of features upon which to focus its attention, while ignoring the rest. To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular domain, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training data interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show improvements over the original design. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter-based approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy on real problems is achieved for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes. 1 Intr...<	H.John, Ron Kohavi	Wrappers for Feature Subset Selection
o	90428	"Suppose that, for a learning task, we have to select one hypothesis out of a set of hypotheses  (that may, for example, have been generated  by multiple applications of a randomized  learning algorithm). A common approach is  to evaluate each hypothesis in the set on some  previously unseen cross-validation data, and  then to select the hypothesis that had the  lowest cross-validation error. But when the  cross-validation data is partially corrupted  such as by noise, and if the set of hypotheses  we are selecting from is large, then ""folklore""  also warns about ""overfitting"" the crossvalidation  data [Klockars and Sax, 1986,  Tukey, 1949, Tukey, 1953]. In this paper, we  explain how this ""overfitting"" really occurs,  and show the surprising result that it can  be overcome by selecting a hypothesis with a  higher cross-validation error, over others with  lower cross-validation errors. We give reasons  for not selecting the hypothesis with the lowest  cross-validation error, and propose a new  algorithm, L..."		"Preventing ""Overfitting"" of Cross-Validation Data"
oo	81915	Ripple down rules (RDR), that is rules with hierarchical exceptions, are used in knowledge acquisition because they provide a well intelligible and modifiable representation for even very  large expert systems. In this paper a formal semantics for RDRs is proposed, that covers  first order rules as well as attribute-value based rules. An algebraic foundation is proposed,  including simplification of RDRs and transformation of RDRs into flat lists of rules and ripple  down rule sets, hence these knowledge representation schemes are put into perspective. It is  shown, that a RDR has a shorter description length than an equivalent decision list.  Induction of rules with exceptions is characterized as bidirectional movement in the hypothesis  space, while known algorithms for learning rules or decision trees either perform a  top-down specialization of the most general or a bottom-up generalization of the most special  hypothesis. Known algorithms for induction of RDRs are summarized and compared  a...	Down Rules, Tobias Scheffer	Algebraic Foundation and Improved Methods of Induction of Ripple Down Rules
x	425490	We present an algorithm for the design of multiple Gabor filters for the segmentation of multi-textured images.  We draw upon earlier results that provide a segmentation  error measure based on the predicted vector  output statistics of multiple filter channels. This segmentation  error measure is used to design the filter  channels for a particular segmentation task. In our approach,  the filter parameters are free to vary from channel  to channel and are not restricted to some predetermined  decomposition of the frequency plane. Thus, our  method can generate more effective filter designs and  result in more effective features for image segmentation  than prior methods. Finally, we present texture  segmentation results that confirm the efficacy of the  proposed procedure. These results show effective segmentation  of 8 textures using as few as 2 filters, whereas  earlier approaches required 13 to 40 filters to segment  5 textures.  1. Introduction  We present a comprehensive procedure for the design...	Thomas P. Weldon, William E. Higgins	An Algorithm for Designing Multiple Gabor Filters for Segmenting Multi-Textured Images
