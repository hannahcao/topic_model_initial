citingPub	214443	. The `-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems. We discuss two `-subsumption algorithms based on  strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals. The class of clauses,  for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic  clauses. We further map the general problem of `-subsumption  to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and  in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Carraghan  and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of  the subsumption search space. We also present empirical results for the  mesh design data set.  1 Introduction  `-subsumption [Rob65] is a correct but incomplete, decidable consequence relation,  while implication is undecidable in general. A clause C `-subsumes D  (C ` ` D), iff there is a substitution `, such that C` ` D.  `-subsumption is used as a consequence relation in many ILP systems, for  the decision if a rule covers an example as ...

oo	137427	Finite element methods are used extensively by engineers and modelling scientists to analyse stresses in physical structures. These structures are represented quantitatively as finite collections of elements. The deformation of each element is computed using linear algebraic equations. In order to design a numerical model of a physical structure it is necessary to decide the appropriate resolution for modelling each component part. Considerable expertise is required in choosing these resolution values. Too fine a mesh leads to unnecessary computational overheads when executing the model. Too coarse a mesh produces intolerable approximation errors. In this paper we demonstrate that rules for deciding on appropriate resolution values can be inductively constructed from expert-provided examples. The Inductive Logic Programming algorithm Golem is employed for this purpose. Cross-validation testing of rules produced by Golem in this domain indicate an acuracy of around 79% correct on unseen...<	Bojan Dolsak, S. H.

o	16972	The field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is concerned with inducing logic programs  from examples in the presence of background  knowledge. This paper defines the ILP  problem, and describes the various syntactic  restrictions that are commonly used for learning  first-order representations. We then derive  some positive results concerning the learnability  of these restricted classes of logic programs,  by reducing the ILP problem to a standard  propositional learning problem. More specifically,  k-clause predicate definitions consisting  of determinate, function-free, non-recursive  Horn clauses with variables of bounded depth  are polynomially learnable under a broad class  of probability distributions, called simple distributions.  Similarly, recursive k-clause definitions  are polynomially learnable under simple  distributions if we allow existential and membership  queries about the target concept.  1 Introduction  Most successes within the field of machine learning have  derived from system...

o	417723	In this paper, we describe two different learning tasks for relational structures. When  learning a classifier for structures, the relational  structures in the training sets are classified  as a whole. Contrarily, when learning  a context dependent classifier for elementary  objects, the elementary objects of the relational  structures in the training set are classified.  In general, the class of an elementary  object will not only depend on its elementary  properties, but also on its context, which has  to be learned, too. We investigate the question  how such classifications can be induced  automatically from a given training set containing  classified structures or classified elementary  objects respectively. We present a  graph theoretic algorithm that allows the description  of the objects in the training set by  automatically constructed attributes. This  allows us to employ well-known methods of  decision tree induction to construct a hypothesis.  We present the system INDIGO ...

xx	71129	In this paper we investigate the efficiency of `-- subsumption (` ` ), the basic provability relation  in ILP. As D ` ` C is NP--complete even if we  restrict ourselves to linked Horn clauses and fix  C to contain only a small constant number of literals,  we investigate in several restrictions of D.  We first adapt the notion of determinate clauses  used in ILP and show that `--subsumption is decidable  in polynomial time if D is determinate  with respect to C. Secondly, we adapt the notion  of k--local Horn clauses and show that `--  subsumption is efficiently computable for some  reasonably small k. We then show how these  results can be combined, to give an efficient reasoning  procedure for determinate k--local Horn  clauses, an ILP--problem recently suggested to  be polynomial predictable by Cohen (1993) by  a simple counting argument. We finally outline  how the `--reduction algorithm, an essential part  of every lgg ILP--learning algorithm, can be improved  by these ideas.  1 INTRODUCTION  The...

o	94985	"Recently there has been increasing interest in systems which induce first order logic programs from examples. However, many difficulties need to be overcome. Well-known algorithms fail to discover correct logical descriptions for large classes of interesting predicates, due either to the intractability of search or overly strong limitations applied to the hypothesis space. In contrast, search is avoided within Plotkin's framework of relative least general generalisation (rlgg). It is replaced by the process of constructing a unique clause which covers a set of examples relative to given background knowledge. However, such a clause can in the worst case contain infinitely many literals, or at best grow exponentially with the number of examples involved. In this paper we introduce the concept of h-easy rlgg clauses and show that they have finite length. We also prove that the length of a certain class of ""determinate"" rlgg is bounded by a polynomial function of certain features of the ba...<"	Shaw C. Feng, S. H.

x	227740	In his famous Model Inference System, Shapiro [10] uses so-called refinement operators to replace too general hypotheses by logically weaker ones. One of these refinement operators  works in the search space of reduced first order sentences. In this article we show that this  operator is not complete for reduced sentences, as he claims. We investigate the relations  between subsumption and refinement as well as the role of a complexity measure. We present  an inverse reduction algorithm which is used in a new refinement operator. This operator is  complete for reduced sentences. Finally, we will relate our new refinement operator with its  dual, a generalization operator, and its possible application in model inference using inverse  resolution.  1 Introduction  In 1981, Shapiro [10] has introduced the notion of model inference. It has since then drawn a  lot of attention in the world of inductive learning using logic. Even now the new operation of  inverse resolution [5] is in fashion, people s...
