citingPub	81915	Ripple down rules (RDR), that is rules with hierarchical exceptions, are used in knowledge acquisition because they provide a well intelligible and modifiable representation for even very  large expert systems. In this paper a formal semantics for RDRs is proposed, that covers  first order rules as well as attribute-value based rules. An algebraic foundation is proposed,  including simplification of RDRs and transformation of RDRs into flat lists of rules and ripple  down rule sets, hence these knowledge representation schemes are put into perspective. It is  shown, that a RDR has a shorter description length than an equivalent decision list.  Induction of rules with exceptions is characterized as bidirectional movement in the hypothesis  space, while known algorithms for learning rules or decision trees either perform a  top-down specialization of the most general or a bottom-up generalization of the most special  hypothesis. Known algorithms for induction of RDRs are summarized and compared  a...	Down Rules, Tobias Scheffer	Algebraic Foundation and Improved Methods of Induction of Ripple Down Rules

oo	84600	"This paper addresses methods of specialising first-order theories within the context of incremental learning systems. We demonstrate the shortcomings  of existing first-order incremental learning systems with regard  to their specialisation mechanisms. We prove that these shortcomings are  fundamental to the use of classical logic. In particular, minimal ""correcting  "" specialisations are not always obtainable within this framework. We  propose instead the adoption of a specialisation scheme based on an existing  non-monotonic logic formalism. This approach overcomes the problems  that arise with incremental learning systems which employ classical logic.  As a side-effect of the formal proofs developed for this paper we define a  function called ""deriv"" which turns out to be an improvement on an existing  explanation-based-generalisation (EBG) algorithm. Prolog code and  a description of the relationship between ""deriv"" and the previous EBG  algorithm are described in an appendix.  1 Introduction  ..."	Michael Bain, S. H.

o	87377	We present a learning algorithm for rule-based concept representations called rippledown rule sets. Ripple-down rule sets allow us to deal with the exceptions for each  rule separately by introducing exception rules, exception rules for each exception rule  etc. up to a constant depth. These local exception rules are in contrast to decision  lists, in which the exception rules must be placed into a global ordering of the rules.  The localization of exceptions makes it possible to represent concepts that have no  decision list representation. On the other hand, decision lists with a constant number  of alternations between rules for different classes can be represented by constant depth  ripple-down rule sets with only a polynomial increase in size. Our algorithm is an  Occam algorithm for constant depth ripple-down rule sets and, hence, a PAC learning  algorithm. It is based on repeatedly applying the greedy approximation method for  the weighted set cover problem to find good exception rule set...	Esko Ukkonen, Heikki Mannila, J.

o	149771	"We present an algorithm for learning sets of rules that are organized into up to k levels. Each level can contain an arbitrary number of rules ""if c then l""  where l is the class associated to the level and c is a concept from a given class  of basic concepts. The rules of higher levels have precedence over the rules  of lower levels and can be used to represent exceptions. As basic concepts we  can use Boolean attributes in the infinite attribute space model, or certain  concepts defined in terms of substrings. Given a sample of m examples, the  algorithm runs in polynomial time and produces a consistent concept representation  of size O((log m)  k  n  k  ), where n is the size of the smallest consistent  representation with k levels of rules. This implies that the algorithm learns  in the PAC model. The algorithm repeatedly applies the greedy heuristics for  weighted set cover. The weights are obtained from approximate solutions to  previous set cover problems.  Key words: computational learni..."	Esko Ukkonen, Heikki Mannila, J. Kivinen	Learning Hierarchical Rule Sets

oo	227904	Due to the inadequacy of attribute-only representations for many learning problems, there is now a renewed interest in algorithms employing first-order  logic or restricted variants thereof as their knowledge representation. In this  paper, we give a brief overview of the dimensions along which the complexity  of learning in such representations can be controlled. We then present RDT, a  model-based learning algorithm for function-free Horn clauses with negation  that introduces two new means of complexity control, namely the use of syntactic  rule models, and the use of a task-oriented domain topology. We briefly  describe some preliminary application results of RDT within the knowledge  acquisition system MOBAL, and present directions of further research.  1 Introduction  As described by Mitchell [Mit82], concept learning from examples can be seen as  a process of search in a space of hypotheses that is ordered by the generality relationship  between hypotheses. The size of this space and the p...	Jorg-uwe Kietz, Stefan Wrobel	Controlling the Complexity of Learning in Logic through Syntactic and Task-Oriented Models
