citingPub	480550	"The problem of the relevance and the usefulness of extracted association rules is of primary importance because, in the majority of  cases, real-life databases lead to several thousands association rules with  high condence and among which are many redundancies. Using the  closure of the Galois connection, we dene two new bases for association  rules which union is a generating set for all valid association rules with  support and condence. These bases are characterized using frequent  closed itemsets and their generators; they consist of the non-redundant  exact and approximate association rules having minimal antecedents and  maximal consequents, i.e. the most relevant association rules. Algorithms  for extracting these bases are presented and results of experiments carried  out on real-life databases show that the proposed bases are useful, and  that their generation is not time consuming."

xx	25887	We are given a large database of customer transactions. Each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. We present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. The algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. We also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.<	Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imielinski	Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases
oo	60805	"One of the most well-studied problems in data mining is mining for association rules in market basket data. Association  rules, whose significance is measured via support and confidence,  are intended to identify rules of the type, ""A customer  purchasing item A often also purchases item B."" Motivated  by the goal of generalizing beyond market baskets and the  association rules used with them, we develop the notion of  mining rules that identify correlations (generalizing associations)  , and we consider both the absence and presence of  items as a basis for generating rules. We propose measuring  significance of associations via the chi-squared test for  correlation from classical statistics. This leads to a measure  that is upward closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce  the mining problem to the search for a border between  correlated and uncorrelated itemsets in the lattice. We develop  pruning strategies and devise an efficient algorithm for  the resulting problem. We demonstrate it..."

oo	132325	Discovery of association rules from large databases has been a focused topic recently in the research into database mining. Previous studies discover association  rules at a single concept level, however, mining association rules at multiple  concept levels may lead to finding more informative and refined knowledge  from data. In this paper, we study efficient methods for mining multiple-level  association rules from large transaction databases. A top-down progressive  deepening method is proposed by extension of some existing (single-level) association  rule mining algorithms. In particular, a group of algorithms for mining  multiple-level association rules are developed and their relative performance are  tested on different kinds of transaction data. Relaxation of the rule conditions  for finding flexible multiple-level association rules is also discussed. Our study  shows that efficient algorithms can be developed for the discovery of interesting  and strong multiple-level association rules f...

oo	27920	"Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami, are rules of the form ""for 90 % of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W , then it has 1 also in column B"". Efficient methods exist for discovering association rules from large collections of data. The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization tool interfaces with rule templates. 1 Introduction Data mining (knowledge discovery in databases) is a field of increasing interest combining databases, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The purpose of data mining is to facilitate understanding large amounts of data by discovering interesting regularities or exceptions (see e...<"	A. Inkeri Verkamo, H. T.

oo	566084	From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge, the present-day model of mining association  rules suffers from the following serious shortcom-  ings: (i) lack of user exploration and control, (ii) lack of  focus, and (iii) rigid notion of relationships. In effect, this  model functions as a black-box, admitting little user interaction  in between. We propose, in this paper, an architecture  that opens up the black-box, and supports constraintbased,  human-centered exploratory mining of associations.  The foundation of this architecture is a rich set of con-  straint constructs, including domain, class, and $QL-style  aggregate constraints, which enable users to clearly specify  what associations are to be mined. We propose constrained  association queries as a means of specifying the constraints  to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined  association.	Alex Pang, Jiawei Hah, Laks V. S.

xx	333360	Discovering association rules is one of the most important task in data mining and many efficient algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The most noticeable are Apriori, Mannila's algorithm, Partition, Sampling and DIC, that are all based on the Apriori mining method: pruning of the subset lattice (itemset lattice). In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm, called Close, based on a new mining method: pruning of the closed set lattice (closed itemset lattice). This lattice, which is a sub-order of the subset lattice, is closely related to Wille's concept lattice in formal concept analysis. Experiments comparing Close to an optimized version of Apriori showed that Close is very efficient for mining dense and/or correlated data such as census data, and performs reasonably well for market basket style data.<	Lotfi Lakhal, Nicolas Pasquier, Rafik Taouil, Yves Bastide	Pruning Closed Itemset Lattices for Association Rules
xx	331366	. In this paper, we address the problem of finding frequent itemsets in a database. Using the closed itemset lattice framework, we  show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of finding frequent  closed itemsets. Based on this statement, we can construct efficient data  mining algorithms by limiting the search space to the closed itemset  lattice rather than the subset lattice. Moreover, we show that the set of all  frequent closed itemsets suffices to determine a reduced set of association  rules, thus addressing another important data mining problem: limiting  the number of rules produced without information loss. We propose a new  algorithm, called A-Close, using a closure mechanism to find frequent  closed itemsets. We realized experiments to compare our approach to  the commonly used frequent itemset search approach. Those experiments  showed that our approach is very valuable for dense and/or correlated  data that represent an important part of existing databases.  1 I...

xx	571981	In this paper, we address the problem of the usefulness of the set of discovered association rules. This problem is important since real-life databases yield most of the time several thousands of rules with  high confidence. We propose new algorithms based on Galois closed sets to reduce the extraction  to small covers, or bases, for exact and approximate rules. Once frequent closed itemsets which  constitute a generating set for both frequent itemsets and association rules have been discovered,  no additional database pass is needed to derive these bases. Experiments conducted on real-life  databases show that these algorithms are efficient and valuable in practice.

oo	55546	One of the central problems in the field of knowledge discovery is the development of good measures of interestingness of discovered patterns. Such measures of interestingness are divided  into objective measures -- those that depend only on the structure of a pattern and the underlying  data used in the discovery process, and the subjective measures -- those that also depend on the  class of users who examine the pattern. The focus of this paper is on studying subjective  measures of interestingness. These measures are classified into actionable and unexpected, and  the relationship between them is examined. The unexpected measure of interestingness is defined  in terms of the belief system that the user has. Interestingness of a pattern is expressed in terms  of how it affects the belief system. The paper also discusses how this unexpected measure of  interestingness can be used in the discovery process.  Key Words: Measures of interestingness, patterns, actionability, unexpectedness, belief...	Alexander Tuzhilin, Avi Silberschatz	What Makes Patterns Interesting in Knowledge Discovery Systems
oo	148045	". One of the more well-studied problems in data mining is the search for association rules in market basket data. Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: ""A customer purchasing item A often  also purchases item B."" Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the  goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules  that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring  significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a  measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for  a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the  closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrat..."

oo	24139	"We introduce the problem of mining generalized association rules. Given a large database of transactions, where each transaction consists of a set of items, and a taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) on the items, we find associations between items at any level of the taxonomy. For example, given a taxonomy that says that jackets is-a outerwear is-a clothes, we may infer a rule that ""people who buy outerwear tend to buy shoes"". This rule may hold even if rules that ""people who buy jackets tend to buy shoes"", and ""people who buy clothes tend to buy shoes"" do not hold. An obvious solution to the problem is to add all ancestors of each item in a transaction to the transaction, and then run any of the algorithms for mining association rules on these ""extended transactions "". However, this ""Basic"" algorithm is not very fast; we present two algorithms, Cumulate and EstMerge, which run 2 to 5 times faster than Basic (and more than 100 times faster on one real-life dataset). We also present a new interes...<"	Rakesh Agrawal, R. Srikant	Mining Generalized Association Rules
oo	761	"The problem of discovering association rules has received considerable research attention and several fast algorithms for mining association rules have been developed. In practice, users are often interested in a subset of association rules. For example, they may only want rules that contain a specific item or rules that contain children of a specific item in a hierarchy. While such constraints can be applied as a postprocessing step, integrating them into the mining algorithm can dramatically reduce the execution time. We consider the problem of integrating constraints that are boolean expressions over the presence or absence of items into the association discovery algorithm. We present three integrated algorithms for mining association rules with item constraints and discuss their tradeoffs. 1. Introduction The problem of discovering association rules was introduced in (Agrawal, Imielinski, &amp; Swami 1993). Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of literals (call...<"	Quoc Vu, Rakesh Agrawal, R. Srikant	Mining Association Rules with Item Constraints
