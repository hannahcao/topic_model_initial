citingPub	486190	In this paper, we address the problem of the efficiency of the main phase of most data mining applications: The frequent pattern extraction. This problem  is mainly related to the number of operations required for counting pattern supports  in the database, and we propose a new method, called pattern counting  inference, that allows to perform as few support counts as possible. Using this  method, the support of a pattern is determined without accessing the database  whenever possible, using the supports of some of its sub-patterns called key patterns.

xx	25887	We are given a large database of customer transactions. Each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. We present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. The algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. We also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.<	Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imielinski	Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases
o	24565	We are given a large database of customer transactions, where each transaction consists of customer-id, transaction time, and the items bought in the transaction. We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction. 1 Introduction Database mining is motivated by the decision support problem faced by most large retail organizations. Progress in bar-code technology has made it po...<	Rakesh Agrawal, R. Srikant	Mining Sequential Patterns
o	56028	"We consider the problem of analyzing market-basket data and present several important contributions. First, we present a new algorithm for finding large itemsets which uses fewer passes over the data than classic algorithms, and yet uses fewer candidate itemsets than methods based on sampling. We investigate the idea of item reordering, which can improve the low-level efficiency of the algorithm. Second, we present a new way of generating ""implication rules,"" which are normalized based on both the antecedent and the consequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence), and we show how they produce more intuitive results than other methods. Finally, we show how different characteristics of real data, as opposed to synthetic data, can dramatically affect the performance of the system and the form of the results. 1 Introduction Within the area of data mining, the problem of deriving associations from data has recently received a great deal of attention.

o	60805	"One of the most well-studied problems in data mining is mining for association rules in market basket data. Association  rules, whose significance is measured via support and confidence,  are intended to identify rules of the type, ""A customer  purchasing item A often also purchases item B."" Motivated  by the goal of generalizing beyond market baskets and the  association rules used with them, we develop the notion of  mining rules that identify correlations (generalizing associations)  , and we consider both the absence and presence of  items as a basis for generating rules. We propose measuring  significance of associations via the chi-squared test for  correlation from classical statistics. This leads to a measure  that is upward closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce  the mining problem to the search for a border between  correlated and uncorrelated itemsets in the lattice. We develop  pruning strategies and devise an efficient algorithm for  the resulting problem. We demonstrate it..."

oo	40240	": Discovery of association rules is an important problem in Data Mining. The classical approach is to generate all itemsets that have support (i.e., the fraction of transactions containing the itemset) above  a user given threshold. Most existing algorithms aim at reducing the number of scans over the transaction  database, i.e., the I/O overhead. We consider the problem of how to calculate efficiently the support, i.e.,  we try to optimize both I/O and CPU time. A straightforward way is to maintain, for each itemset, the  relevant transaction identifiers directly into a list and use a sort-merge algorithm to do the intersection of  two itemsets. Instead, we propose bitmap based algorithms. The basic idea is that every couple  &lt;transaction - item&gt; is represented by a bit in an index bitmap, and the logical operation AND is used in  place of the sort-merge algorithm. We propose two variations of the bitmap based algorithm : the na&#239;ve  bitmap algorithm (N-BM) and the hierarchical bitmap algorith..."	C. F. J.

o	312653	Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, timeseries databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist proli#c patterns and#or long patterns. In this study,we propose a novel frequent pattern tree #FP-tree# structure, which is an extended pre#xtree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an e#cient FP-tree- based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. E#ciency of mining is achieved with three techniques: #1# a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, whichavoids costly, repeated database scans, #2# our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large n...<	Jiawei Pei, Yiwen Yin	Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation

oo	157405	We consider the problem of clustering two-dimensional association rules in large databases. We present a geometric-based algorithm, BitOp, for performing the clustering, embedded within an association rule  clustering system, ARCS. Association rule clustering is useful when the user desires to segment the data.  We measure the quality of the segmentation generated by ARCS using the Minimum Description Length  (MDL) principle of encoding the clusters on several databases including noise and errors. Scale-up  experiments show that ARCS, using the BitOp algorithm, scales linearly with the amount of data.  1 Introduction  Data mining, or the efficient discovery of interesting patterns from large collections of data, has been recognized  as an important area of database research. The most commonly sought patterns are association  rules as introduced in [AIS93b]. Intuitively, an association rule identifies a frequently occuring pattern of  information in a database. Consider a supermarket database w...	Brian Lent, Jennifer Widom	Clustering Association Rules
oo	235855	Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms  for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up breadth-first search direction. The computation  starts from frequent 1-itemsets (minimal length frequent itemsets) and continues until all  maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is  explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform reasonably well when all maximal frequent itemsets  are short. However, performance drastically decreases when some of the maximal frequent  itemsets are relatively long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up  and top-down directions. The main search direction is still bottom-up but a restricted search  is conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating  a new data structure we designed, the maximum frequent candidat...	Dao-i Lin, Z. M.

oo	21659	"Association rules are statements of the form ""for 90 % of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W , then it has 1 also in column B"". Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami introduced the problem of mining association rules from large collections of data, and gave a method based on successive passes over the database. We give an improved algorithm for the problem. The method is based on careful combinatorial analysis of the information obtained in previous passes; this makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary candidate rules. Experiments on a university course enrollment database indicate that the method outperforms the previous one by a factor of 5. We also show that sampling is in general a very efficient way of finding such rules.

oo	33618	Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of users or systems can be collected in several domains. We consider the problem of discovering frequently occurring episodes in such sequences. An episode is defined to be a collection of events that occur relatively close to each other in a given partial order. Once such episodes are known, one can produce rules for describing or predicting the behavior of the sequence. We give efficient algorithms for the discovery of all frequent episodes from a given class of episodes, and present extensive experimental results. The methods are in use in telecommunication alarm management.<	A. Inkeri Verkamo, H. T. Toivonen, Heikki Mannila	Discovery of Frequent Episodes in Event Sequences
x	41760	One of the basic problems in knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is the following: given a data set r, a class L of sentences for defining subgroups of r, and a selection predicate, find all sentences of L deemed interesting by the selection predicate. We analyze the simple levelwise algorithm for finding all such descriptions. We give bounds for the number of database accesses that the algorithm makes. For this, we introduce the concept of the border of a theory, a notion that turns out to be surprisingly powerful in analyzing the algorithm. We also consider the verification problem of a KDD process: given r and a set of sentences S ` L, determine whether S is exactly the set of interesting statements about r. We show strong connections between the verification problem and the hypergraph transversal problem. The verification problem arises in a natural way when using sampling to speed up the pattern discovery step in KDD.<	H. T.

xx	333360	Discovering association rules is one of the most important task in data mining and many efficient algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The most noticeable are Apriori, Mannila's algorithm, Partition, Sampling and DIC, that are all based on the Apriori mining method: pruning of the subset lattice (itemset lattice). In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm, called Close, based on a new mining method: pruning of the closed set lattice (closed itemset lattice). This lattice, which is a sub-order of the subset lattice, is closely related to Wille's concept lattice in formal concept analysis. Experiments comparing Close to an optimized version of Apriori showed that Close is very efficient for mining dense and/or correlated data such as census data, and performs reasonably well for market basket style data.<	Lotfi Lakhal, Nicolas Pasquier, Rafik Taouil, Yves Bastide	Pruning Closed Itemset Lattices for Association Rules

x	431896	Association mining may often derive an undesirably large set of frequent itemsets and association rules. Recent studies have proposed an interesting alternative: mining frequent closed itemsets and their corresponding rules, which has the same power as association mining but substantially reduces the number of rules to be presented. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, CLOSET, for mining closed itemsets, with the development of three techniques: (1) applying a compressed, frequent pattern tree FP-tree structure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation, (2) developing a single prefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly, and (3) exploring a partition-based projection mechanism for scalable mining in large databases. Our performance study shows that CLOSET is efficient and scalable over large databases, and is faster than the previously proposed methods. 1 Introduction It has been well recognized that frequent pattern minin...<	Jian Pei, Jiawei Han, Runying Mao	CLOSET: An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Frequent Closed Itemsets
o	148045	". One of the more well-studied problems in data mining is the search for association rules in market basket data. Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: ""A customer purchasing item A often  also purchases item B."" Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the  goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules  that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring  significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a  measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for  a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the  closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrat..."

oo	33021	Discovery of association rules is an important database mining problem. Current algorithms for finding association rules require several passes over the analyzed database, and obviously the role of I/O overhead is very significant for very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce the database activity considerably. The idea is to pick a random sample, to find using this sample all association rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then to verify the results with the rest of the database. The algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, probabilistic, and in those rare cases where our sampling method does not produce all association rules, the missing rules can be found in a second pass. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find association rules very efficiently in only one database pass. 1 Introduction Database mining, or knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), has in the ...<	H.

o	5881	Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying  the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among  them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent  itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms  utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery.  The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the  potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a  sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented,  which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all  their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database  layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques.  The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) d...
