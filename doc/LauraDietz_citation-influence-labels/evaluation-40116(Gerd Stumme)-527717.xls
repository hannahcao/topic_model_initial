Especially in the field of life-long learning the aspects that need to be taught by information providers  must keep up to date with emerging topics. The courseware watchdog is a comprehensive  module which allows users to focus on existing subfields of a discipline, but  thereby be aware of important ch'ifts and tendencies in the field.

xx	409675	. CEM is an email management system which stores its email in a concept lattice rather than in the usual tree structure. By using  such a conceptual multi-hierarchy, the system provides more flexibility in  retrieving stored emails. The paper presents the underlying mathematical  structures, discusses requirements for their maintenance and presents  their implementation.  1 Motivation  The way standard email management systems store mails is directly derived  from the tree structure of file management systems. This has the advantage that  trees have a simple structure which can easily be explained to novice users. The  disadvantage is that at the moment of storing an email the user already has  to foresee the way she is going to retrieve the mail later. The tree structure  forces her to decide at that moment which criteria to consider as primary and  which as secondary. For instance, when storing an email regarding the organization  of a conference, one has to decide whether to organize one'...	Gerd Stumme, Richard Cole	CEM - A Conceptual Email Manager

Einstein Learning can no longer be dichotomized into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and  a place and time to apply knowledge (the workplace). Todays citizens are flooded with more  information than they can handle, and tomorrows workers will need to know far more than any  individual can retain.  Lifelong learning is an essential challenge for inventing the future of our societies; it is a  necessity rather than a possibility or a luxury to be considered. Lifelong learning is more than  adult education and/or training it is a mindset and a habit for people to acquire. Lifelong  learning creates the challenge to understand, explore, and support new essential dimensions of  learning such as: (1) self-directed learning, (2) learning on demand, (3) collaborative learning,  and (4) organizational learning. These approaches need new media and innovative  technologies to be adequately supported.  A theory of l..."	Gerhard Fischer, Piet Kommers	Lifelong Learning - More Than Training

Correspondingly, concept descriptions of terminological  knowledge bases for such domains must be adjusted to these  dynamics. In this paper we propose a concept versioning methodology which  accounts for the evolutionary adaptation of already established concepts according  to the gradual shaping of new standards. The approach is based on the  provision of qualitative progress models for the given domain, measures for  the prediction and evaluation of the significance of progress, and a representation  and update scheme for concept version management.  1 INTRODUCTION  Technical domains, such as information, hi-fi, or automobile technology,  share a common feature, namely that their underlying concept  systems undergo continuous change. These dynamics are exhibited  either by the substantial augmentation of concept systems in terms of  concept innovations (mirroring the introduction of new products,  t...

The term ""Semantic  Web"" encompasses efforts to build a new WWW architecture that enhances content with formal  semantics, which enables better possibilities for navigating through the cyberspace and accessing  its contents. As such, the Semantic Web represents a promising technology for realizing eLearning  requirements."	Ljiljana Stojanovic, Rudi Studer, Steen Staab	eLearning based on the Semantic Web
