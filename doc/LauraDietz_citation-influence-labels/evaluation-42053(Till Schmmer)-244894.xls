citingPub	244894	implemented in VisualWorks Smalltalk supports developers of synchronous groupware such that the  required development effort does not exceed that of a  classical single-user application. COAST provides a  basic groupware architecture, an environment for the  construction of groupware applications, and a  methodology for the development of synchronous  groupware.  At implementation time COAST assists developers  through the following key features:  . modeling of the (shared) domain model using the  COAST description language  . a pre-defined extensible model of users and their  work environments  . user interface builder providing co-operative  widgets  At runtime, COAST applications benefit from  transparent replication of data objects, transaction  processing to ensure data consistency and automatic  update of views when shared data objects change.  The COAST framework is available for non-profit use  (academic and evaluation purposes).

o	222722	Today, most cooperative systems support primarily either asynchronous or synchronous (real time) cooperative work.  We feel that both synchronous and asynchronous cooperation  are extremely important aspects of working in groups, and to  ignore one or the other is to supply only half a solution to users.  In this paper, we describe the extension of the hypertext  authoring system SEPIA developed at GMD-IPSI to support  cooperative work among hypertext authors. Cooperative  SEPIA is unique not only in its ability to support cooperative  work in both of these categories, but also in how smoothly and  naturally it supports the transition between these two categories.  KEYWORDS  CSCW, Hypertext, Hypertext authoring, Collaborative  Writing, modes of collaboration  INTRODUCTION  It is a well known fact that documents are often created by a  group of authors. This is especially true for large hyperdocuments.  Adding further to this complexity, authors are commonly  distributed over different locations. C...	M. Wilson, Jorg M.

xx	195548	This paper introduces COAST, an object-oriented toolkit for the development of synchronous groupware,  which enhances the usability and simplifies the  development of such applications. COAST offers basic  and generic components for the design of synchronous  groupware and is complemented by a methodology for  groupware development. Basic features of the toolkit  include transaction-controlled access to replicated  shared objects, transparent replication management,  and a fully optimistic concurrency control.  Development support is provided by a session concept  supporting the flexible coupling of shared objects'  aspects between concurrent users and by a fully  transparent updating concept for displays which is  based on declarative programming.  KEYWORDS: toolkit, synchronous collaboration,  groupware, replicated objects, sessions, display  updating, concurrency control  1 INTRODUCTION  Groupware allows several geographically distributed  people to work together with the aid of a computerized  envi...

o	176607	This paper describes DOLPHIN, a fully group aware application designed to provide computer support for  different types of meetings: face--to--face meetings with  a large interactive electronic whiteboard with or  without networked computers provided to the  participants, extensions of these meetings with remote  participants at their desktop computers connected via  computer and audio/video networks and/ or participants  in a second meeting room also provided with an  electronic whiteboard and networked computers.  DOLPHIN supports the creation and manipulation of  informal structures (e.g. free hand drawings,  handwritten scribbles) as well as formal structures (e.g.  hypermedia documents with typed nodes and links) and  their coexistence and transformation.  KEYWORDS: electronic meeting rooms, document--  based cooperation, shared workspaces, collaborative  writing/drawing, brainstorming, planning, hypermedia,  pen--based interaction, interactive whiteboards  1 INTRODUCTION  Cooperation of people can ...
