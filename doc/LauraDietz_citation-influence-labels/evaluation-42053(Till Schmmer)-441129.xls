o	10883	Awareness of individual and group activities is critical to successful collaboration and is commonly supported in CSCW systems by active, information generation mechanisms separate from the shared workspace. These mechanisms penalise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult. We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited passively through the shared workspace, allows users to move smoothly between close and loose collaboration, and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches. KEYWORDS: Awareness, information sharing, coordination, shared workspaces, shared feedback. 1 INTRODUCTION Studies of collaborative writing [e.g. 2, 7, 16] highlight the extent to which information sharing, knowledge of group and individual activity, and coor...<	Cambridge Europarc, Paul Dourish, V.

o	433211	Shared physical workspaces allow people to maintain upto -the minute knowledge about others' interaction with the  workspace. This knowledge is workspace awareness, part  of the glue that allows groups to collaborate effectively. In  this paper, we present the concept of workspace awareness  as a key for groupware systems that wish to support the  fluid interaction evident in face-to-face collaboration. We  discuss why workspace awareness is difficult to support in  groupware systems, and then present a conceptual  framework that groupware designers can use as a starting  point for thinking about and supporting awareness.  KEYWORDS: Workspace awareness, groupware, CSCW  INTRODUCTION  Shared physical workspaces (such as a chalkboard, a  control panel, or a tabletop) and the artifacts in them act as  stage and props for rich person-to-person interaction (e.g.  [1]). The affordances of physical workspaces allow people  to maintain awareness of others' locations, activities, and  intentions relative to ...

oo	181141	We introduce a model for supporting collaborative work between people that are physically close to each other. We call this model Single Display Groupware (SDG). In this paper, we describe this model, comparing it to more traditional remote  collaboration. We describe the requirements that SDG places on computer technology, and our understanding of the benefits  and costs of SDG systems. Finally, we describe a prototype SDG system that we built and the results of a usability test we  ran with 60 elementary school children.  Keywords  CSCW, Single Display Groupware, children, educational applications, input devices, Pad++, KidPad.  INTRODUCTION  In the early 1970's, researchers at Xerox PARC created an atmosphere in which they lived and worked with technology of the  future. When the world's first personal computer, the Alto, was invented, it had only a single keyboard and mouse. This  fundamental design legacy has carried through to nearly all modern computer systems. Although networks have...	Allison Druin, Benjamin B. Bederson, Jason Stewart	Single Display Groupware: A Model for Co-present Collaboration
