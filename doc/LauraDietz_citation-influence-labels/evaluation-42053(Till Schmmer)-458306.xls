Community support tools, such as chat systems or  newsgroups try to fill this gap. We argue that a new architecture is needed that  brings together customers with common interests. We propose a combined  system called GAMA-Mall based on a spatial representation of the shop, which  implements this architecture.  	Till Schmmer	GAMA-Mall - shopping in communities

o	316528	"This report describes zippers, an application of outline-processor technology to the display of Web pages. Zippers allow users to expand and contract selected sections  of a document, thereby displaying simultaneously the contents of individual sections  of a document as well as its overall structure. Zippers can be implemented either  directly in a Web browser or by a proxy (and consequently used by any off-theshelf  Web browser); in either case, no changes to HTML source files are required.  Overview  As people rush to put information onto the World Wide Web, more and more structured  documents are appearing. These documents include home pages with lots  of hierarchically organized links, papers with many sections and subsections, and  other lengthy documents such as books and manuals.  All Web browsers that we know of display each page as a continuous scroll.  Unfortunately, it is easy to lose context when viewing a snippet of the whole, and it  is hard to jump to arbitrary places in the pag..."	Marc H. Brown, William E.

xx	412695	The paper presents a system for synchronous cooperative browsing that permits users within a  workgroup to share information and cooperate toward  a common goal. The system implementation is based on  a Java proxy, to achieve portability without requiring  modification neither to browsers nor to servers. In  addition, the paper shows that the implemented system  defines a general framework for interactive multi-user  WWW applications.  1 Introduction  As the amount of information available in the Web  increases and Internet connectivity is becoming a sinequa  -non for any organization, people spend more and  more time in net surfing activities, in the effort of  retrieving data for their purposes. However, because of  the large amount of information and because of slow  network connections, this activity tends to be very time  consuming and frustrating. We argue that the capability  of supporting cooperative WWW searching session is  important to save time in organization and to retrieve  data ...

xx	10883	Awareness of individual and group activities is critical to successful collaboration and is commonly supported in CSCW systems by active, information generation mechanisms separate from the shared workspace. These mechanisms penalise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult. We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited passively through the shared workspace, allows users to move smoothly between close and loose collaboration, and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches. KEYWORDS: Awareness, information sharing, coordination, shared workspaces, shared feedback. 1 INTRODUCTION Studies of collaborative writing [e.g. 2, 7, 16] highlight the extent to which information sharing, knowledge of group and individual activity, and coor...<	Cambridge Europarc, Paul Dourish, V.

xx	85503	This paper is concerned with how collaborative virtual environments can be structured in order to enable greater  scalability and yet maintain a richness of communication.  Based on a survey of current work in this area a number of  important issues and design criteria are drawn out. In this  context a recent extension to the spatial model of interaction  called third party objects is described which can be  used to develop a variety of spatial structures which have  different effects on mutual awareness and communication.  These structures include nested regions and zones,  dynamic data districts and potentially mobile crowds of  participants. The paper also discusses how these structures  can be exploited by an underlying network architecture  based on a dynamically evolving hierarchy of  multicast groups and describes the MASSIVE-2 system  which implements it.  1. Introduction  Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) involve  the use of distributed virtual reality technology to support  cooperativ...

o	361022	Together with the rapidly growing amount of online data we register an immense need for intelligent search engines that access a restricted amount of data as found in intranets or other limited domains. This sort of search engines must go beyond simple keyword indexing/matching, but they also have to be easily adaptable to new domains without huge costs. This paper presents a mechanism that addresses both of these points: first of all, the internal document structure is being used to extract concepts which impose a directorylike structure on the documents similar to those found in classified directories. Furthermore, this is done in an efficient way which is largely language independent and does not make assumptions about the document structure.<	Colchester Co Sq, Udo Kruschwitz	Exploiting Structure for Intelligent Web Search
x	187698	Although tools for managing Web-based information are primitive, the number of institutions using the Web as an information system continues to grow rapidly. The World Wide Web has  become a world-wide information system in spite of the lack of features common to most  information systems. Many of the tools used to manage Web-based information utilize either a  database or a proxy HTTP server to organize and classify information and user-specific data.  This paper explores the use of these tools and proposes that the combination of proxy server  and database is a more powerful management tool.  1. Information Management  The World Wide Web represents an information source that will change IT departments world-wide once  difficulties associated with accessing and organizing the information are addressed. Information systems are  only useful when they make storing and finding information simpler and faster than placing a paper copy in a  file cabinet. To fulfill that requirement, information syst...
