The ability to synchronously and asynchronously edit work artefacts has become very important in many editing  tools. However, most tools usually only provide one kind  of collaborative editing "level", or provide incompatible  levels of collaborative editing. We describe our recent work  in adding flexible, user-configurable collaborative editing  facilities to component-based design environments, and  focuses on the human interaction issues in such systems.  We also briefly describe the engineering of such tools  using a component-based approach, which allows userconfigurable  collaborative editing capabilities to be added  to component-based tools without modifying the tool or  collaboration component implementations.  1. Introduction  Users of many editing tools require facilities to support  collaborative editing i.e. multi-user collaboration on the  development of work artefacts. This is common when  using tools such as CASE (Computer-Aided Software  Engineering) tools, CAD (Computer-Aided Desig...
