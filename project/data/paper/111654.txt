` subsumption is a decidable but incomplete approximation of logic implication, important to inductive logic programming and theorem proving. We show that by context based elimination of  possible matches a certain superset of the determinate clauses can be tested for subsumption in  polynomial time. We discuss the relation between subsumption and the clique problem, showing in  particular that using additional prior knowledge about the substitution space only a small fraction  of the search space can be identified as possibly containing globally consistent solutions, which  leads to an effective pruning rule. We present empirical results, demonstrating that a combination  of both of the above approaches provides an extreme reduction of computational effort.  1. Introduction  `-subsumption (Robinson, 1965) is a correct but incomplete,e.g., decidable consequence relation,  while implication is undecidable in general. A clause C `-subsumes D (C ` ` D), iff there is a  substitution `, such that C`...
