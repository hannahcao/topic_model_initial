In image segmentation problems, there is usually a vast amount of filter operations available, a subset of which has to be selected and instantiated  in order to obtain a satisfactory segmentation procedure for a particular domain.  In supervised segmentation, a mapping from features, such as filter  outputs for individual pixels, to classes is induced automatically. However,  since the sample size required for supervised learning grows exponentially  in the number of features it is not feasible to learn a segmentation procedure  from a large amount of possible filters. But we argue that automatic model  selection methods are able to select a region model in terms of some filters.  This paper is printed in Proceedings of Workshop on Visual Information Processing, Sydney  1997, pp. 11-21  We propose a wrapper algorithm that performs this task. We present results  on artificial textured images (Brodatz) and report on our experiences with  x--ray images.  Keywords: model based image segmentation, ...
