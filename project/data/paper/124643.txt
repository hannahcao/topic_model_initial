#abstract
this paper, we motivate, describe, and illustrate the main components of FLECSE, thereby providing an initial answer  to the following fundamental question: In what ways must a traditional software engineering environment be  extended to allow software engineering tasks to be carried out more concurrently?  A definitive answer to this question requires several iterations of (i) identifying concurrent software  engineering scenarios, (ii) developing an environment that supports these scenarios, (iii) experimenting with the  environment in controlled settings, and (iv) testing the environment in the field. We have carried out mainly steps  (i) and (ii) of a preliminary iteration of this process, so our answers to this question are not yet ideal. However,  we believe our work is a necessary and important step towards practical environments for supporting concurrent  software engineering.  In the remaining discussion we will examine five important themes of concurrent software engineering:
