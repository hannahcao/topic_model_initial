Discovery of association rules from large databases has been a focused topic recently in the research into database mining. Previous studies discover association  rules at a single concept level, however, mining association rules at multiple  concept levels may lead to finding more informative and refined knowledge  from data. In this paper, we study efficient methods for mining multiple-level  association rules from large transaction databases. A top-down progressive  deepening method is proposed by extension of some existing (single-level) association  rule mining algorithms. In particular, a group of algorithms for mining  multiple-level association rules are developed and their relative performance are  tested on different kinds of transaction data. Relaxation of the rule conditions  for finding flexible multiple-level association rules is also discussed. Our study  shows that efficient algorithms can be developed for the discovery of interesting  and strong multiple-level association rules f...
