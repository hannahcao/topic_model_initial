Finite element methods are used extensively by engineers and modelling scientists to analyse stresses in physical structures. These structures are represented quantitatively as finite collections of elements. The deformation of each element is computed using linear algebraic equations. In order to design a numerical model of a physical structure it is necessary to decide the appropriate resolution for modelling each component part. Considerable expertise is required in choosing these resolution values. Too fine a mesh leads to unnecessary computational overheads when executing the model. Too coarse a mesh produces intolerable approximation errors. In this paper we demonstrate that rules for deciding on appropriate resolution values can be inductively constructed from expert-provided examples. The Inductive Logic Programming algorithm Golem is employed for this purpose. Cross-validation testing of rules produced by Golem in this domain indicate an acuracy of around 79% correct on unseen...<
