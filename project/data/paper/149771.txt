We present an algorithm for learning sets of rules that are organized into up to k levels. Each level can contain an arbitrary number of rules "if c then l"  where l is the class associated to the level and c is a concept from a given class  of basic concepts. The rules of higher levels have precedence over the rules  of lower levels and can be used to represent exceptions. As basic concepts we  can use Boolean attributes in the infinite attribute space model, or certain  concepts defined in terms of substrings. Given a sample of m examples, the  algorithm runs in polynomial time and produces a consistent concept representation  of size O((log m)  k  n  k  ), where n is the size of the smallest consistent  representation with k levels of rules. This implies that the algorithm learns  in the PAC model. The algorithm repeatedly applies the greedy heuristics for  weighted set cover. The weights are obtained from approximate solutions to  previous set cover problems.  Key words: computational learni...
