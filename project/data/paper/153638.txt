If we lack relevant problem-specific knowledge, cross-validation methods may be used to select a classification method empirically. We  examine this idea here to show in what senses cross-validation does  and does not solve the selection problem. As illustrated empirically,  cross-validation may lead to higher average performance than application  of any single classification strategy and it also cuts the risk of  poor performance. On the other hand, cross-validation is no more or  less a form of bias than simpler strategies and applying it appropriately  ultimately depends in the same way on prior knowledge. In fact,  cross-validation may be seen as a way of applying partial information  about the applicability of alternative classification strategies.  Keywords: Cross-validation, classification, decision trees, neural networks.  1 Introduction  Machine learning researchers and statisticians have produced a host of approaches  to the problem of classification including methods for inducing rul...
