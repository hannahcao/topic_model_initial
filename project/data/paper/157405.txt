We consider the problem of clustering two-dimensional association rules in large databases. We present a geometric-based algorithm, BitOp, for performing the clustering, embedded within an association rule  clustering system, ARCS. Association rule clustering is useful when the user desires to segment the data.  We measure the quality of the segmentation generated by ARCS using the Minimum Description Length  (MDL) principle of encoding the clusters on several databases including noise and errors. Scale-up  experiments show that ARCS, using the BitOp algorithm, scales linearly with the amount of data.  1 Introduction  Data mining, or the efficient discovery of interesting patterns from large collections of data, has been recognized  as an important area of database research. The most commonly sought patterns are association  rules as introduced in [AIS93b]. Intuitively, an association rule identifies a frequently occuring pattern of  information in a database. Consider a supermarket database w...
