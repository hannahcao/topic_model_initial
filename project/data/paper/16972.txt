The field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is concerned with inducing logic programs  from examples in the presence of background  knowledge. This paper defines the ILP  problem, and describes the various syntactic  restrictions that are commonly used for learning  first-order representations. We then derive  some positive results concerning the learnability  of these restricted classes of logic programs,  by reducing the ILP problem to a standard  propositional learning problem. More specifically,  k-clause predicate definitions consisting  of determinate, function-free, non-recursive  Horn clauses with variables of bounded depth  are polynomially learnable under a broad class  of probability distributions, called simple distributions.  Similarly, recursive k-clause definitions  are polynomially learnable under simple  distributions if we allow existential and membership  queries about the target concept.  1 Introduction  Most successes within the field of machine learning have  derived from system...
