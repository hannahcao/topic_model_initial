Strategies for increasing predictive accuracy through selective pruning have been widely adopted by researchers in decision tree induction. It  is easy to get the impression from research reports that there are statistical  reasons for believing that these overfitting avoidance strategies  do increase accuracy and that, as a research community, we are making  progress toward developing powerful, general methods for guarding  against overfitting in inducing decision trees. In fact, any overfitting  avoidance strategy amounts to a form of bias and, as such, may degrade  performance instead of improving it. If pruning methods have  often proven successful in empirical tests, this is due, not to the methods,  but to the choice of test problems. As examples in this article  illustrate, overfitting avoidance strategies are not better or worse, but  only more or less appropriate to specific application domains. We are  not---and cannot be---making progress toward methods both powerful  and general.  The ...
