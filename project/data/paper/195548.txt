This paper introduces COAST, an object-oriented toolkit for the development of synchronous groupware,  which enhances the usability and simplifies the  development of such applications. COAST offers basic  and generic components for the design of synchronous  groupware and is complemented by a methodology for  groupware development. Basic features of the toolkit  include transaction-controlled access to replicated  shared objects, transparent replication management,  and a fully optimistic concurrency control.  Development support is provided by a session concept  supporting the flexible coupling of shared objects'  aspects between concurrent users and by a fully  transparent updating concept for displays which is  based on declarative programming.  KEYWORDS: toolkit, synchronous collaboration,  groupware, replicated objects, sessions, display  updating, concurrency control  1 INTRODUCTION  Groupware allows several geographically distributed  people to work together with the aid of a computerized  envi...
