. The `-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems. We discuss two `-subsumption algorithms based on  strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals. The class of clauses,  for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic  clauses. We further map the general problem of `-subsumption  to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and  in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Carraghan  and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of  the subsumption search space. We also present empirical results for the  mesh design data set.  1 Introduction  `-subsumption [Rob65] is a correct but incomplete, decidable consequence relation,  while implication is undecidable in general. A clause C `-subsumes D  (C ` ` D), iff there is a substitution `, such that C` ` D.  `-subsumption is used as a consequence relation in many ILP systems, for  the decision if a rule covers an example as ...
