#abstract
A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive characteristics of the parent subjects  of Logic Programming and Machine Learning, it is hoped that the new area will  overcome many of the limitations of its forebears. The background to present  developments within this area is discussed and various goals and aspirations for  the increasing body of researchers are identified. Inductive Logic Programming  needs to be based on sound principles from both Logic and Statistics. On the  side of statistical justification of hypotheses we discuss the possible relationship between  Algorithmic Complexity theory and Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)  Learning. In terms of logic we provide a unifying framework for Muggleton and  Buntine's Inverse Resolution (IR) and Plotkin's Relative Least General Generalisation  (RLGG) by rederiving RLGG in terms of IR. This leads to a discussion of  the feasibility of extending the RLGG framework to allow for t...
