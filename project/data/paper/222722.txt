We feel that both synchronous and asynchronous cooperation  are extremely important aspects of working in groups, and to  ignore one or the other is to supply only half a solution to users.  In this paper, we describe the extension of the hypertext  authoring system SEPIA developed at GMD-IPSI to support  cooperative work among hypertext authors. Cooperative  SEPIA is unique not only in its ability to support cooperative  work in both of these categories, but also in how smoothly and  naturally it supports the transition between these two categories.

This is especially true for large hyperdocuments.  Adding further to this complexity, authors are commonly  distributed over different locations. C...
