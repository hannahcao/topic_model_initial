. Technical domains are affected by continuous change as a reflection of technological progress. Correspondingly, concept descriptions of terminological  knowledge bases for such domains must be adjusted to these  dynamics. In this paper we propose a concept versioning methodology which  accounts for the evolutionary adaptation of already established concepts according  to the gradual shaping of new standards. The approach is based on the  provision of qualitative progress models for the given domain, measures for  the prediction and evaluation of the significance of progress, and a representation  and update scheme for concept version management.  1 INTRODUCTION  Technical domains, such as information, hi-fi, or automobile technology,  share a common feature, namely that their underlying concept  systems undergo continuous change. These dynamics are exhibited  either by the substantial augmentation of concept systems in terms of  concept innovations (mirroring the introduction of new products,  t...
