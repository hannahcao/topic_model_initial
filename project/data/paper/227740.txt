In his famous Model Inference System, Shapiro [10] uses so-called refinement operators to replace too general hypotheses by logically weaker ones. One of these refinement operators  works in the search space of reduced first order sentences. In this article we show that this  operator is not complete for reduced sentences, as he claims. We investigate the relations  between subsumption and refinement as well as the role of a complexity measure. We present  an inverse reduction algorithm which is used in a new refinement operator. This operator is  complete for reduced sentences. Finally, we will relate our new refinement operator with its  dual, a generalization operator, and its possible application in model inference using inverse  resolution.  1 Introduction  In 1981, Shapiro [10] has introduced the notion of model inference. It has since then drawn a  lot of attention in the world of inductive learning using logic. Even now the new operation of  inverse resolution [5] is in fashion, people s...
