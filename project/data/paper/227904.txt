Due to the inadequacy of attribute-only representations for many learning problems, there is now a renewed interest in algorithms employing first-order  logic or restricted variants thereof as their knowledge representation. In this  paper, we give a brief overview of the dimensions along which the complexity  of learning in such representations can be controlled. We then present RDT, a  model-based learning algorithm for function-free Horn clauses with negation  that introduces two new means of complexity control, namely the use of syntactic  rule models, and the use of a task-oriented domain topology. We briefly  describe some preliminary application results of RDT within the knowledge  acquisition system MOBAL, and present directions of further research.  1 Introduction  As described by Mitchell [Mit82], concept learning from examples can be seen as  a process of search in a space of hypotheses that is ordered by the generality relationship  between hypotheses. The size of this space and the p...
