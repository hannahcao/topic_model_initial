Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms  for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up breadth-first search direction. The computation  starts from frequent 1-itemsets (minimal length frequent itemsets) and continues until all  maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is  explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform reasonably well when all maximal frequent itemsets  are short. However, performance drastically decreases when some of the maximal frequent  itemsets are relatively long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up  and top-down directions. The main search direction is still bottom-up but a restricted search  is conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating  a new data structure we designed, the maximum frequent candidat...
