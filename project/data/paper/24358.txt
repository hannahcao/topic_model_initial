The Amulet user interface development environment makes it easier for programmers to create highly-interactive, graphical user interface software for Unix, Windows or the  Macintosh. Amulet uses new models for objects, constraints, animation, input, output,  commands, and undo. The object system is a prototype-instance model in which there is  no distinction between classes and instances or between methods and data. The constraint  system allows any value of any object to be computed by arbitrary code and supports  multiple constraint solvers. Animations can be attached to existing objects with a single  line of code. Input from the user is handled by "interactor" objects which support reuse of  behavior objects. The output model provides a declarative definition of the graphics and  supports automatic refresh. Command objects encapsulate all of the information needed  about operations, including support for various ways to undo them. A key feature of the  Amulet design is that all graphical obj...
