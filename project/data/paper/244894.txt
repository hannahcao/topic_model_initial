implemented in VisualWorks Smalltalk supports developers of synchronous groupware such that the  required development effort does not exceed that of a  classical single-user application. COAST provides a  basic groupware architecture, an environment for the  construction of groupware applications, and a  methodology for the development of synchronous  groupware.  At implementation time COAST assists developers  through the following key features:  . modeling of the (shared) domain model using the  COAST description language  . a pre-defined extensible model of users and their  work environments  . user interface builder providing co-operative  widgets  At runtime, COAST applications benefit from  transparent replication of data objects, transaction  processing to ensure data consistency and automatic  update of views when shared data objects change.  The COAST framework is available for non-profit use  (academic and evaluation purposes). More detailed
