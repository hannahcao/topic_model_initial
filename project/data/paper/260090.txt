Our scenario  of this work covers the following activities. First, mobile  individuals can create "personal" notes on their PDAs.  Second, when individuals meet in real time, they can  selectively "publicize" notes by moving them to a shared  public display. Third, the group can manipulate personal  and public items in real time through both PDAs and the  shared public display, where the notes contained on both  PDAs and public display are automatically synchronized.  Finally, people leave a meeting with a common record of  their activity. We describe our SharedNotes system that  illustrates how people move through this scenario. We also  highlight a variety of problematic design issues that result  from having different devices and from having the system  enforce a rigid distinction between personal and public  information.
