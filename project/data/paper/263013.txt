: We give an analysis of the generalization error of cross validation in terms of two natural measures of the difficulty of the problem under consideration: the approximation rate (the accuracy to which the target function  can be ideally approximated as a function of the number of hypothesis parameters), and the estimation rate (the  deviation between the training and generalization errors as a function of the number of hypothesis parameters). The  approximation rate captures the complexity of the target function with respect to the hypothesis model, and the  estimation rate captures the extent to which the hypothesis model suffers from overfitting. Using these two measures,  we give a rigorous and general bound on the error of cross validation. The bound clearly shows the tradeoffs involved  with making fl --- the fraction of data saved for testing --- too large or too small. By optimizing the bound with  respect to fl, we then argue (through a combination of formal analysis, plotting, and ...
