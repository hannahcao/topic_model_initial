The `-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems. We  discuss a graph-based `-subsumption algorithm  for preselecting suitable matching  literals. We further map the general problem  of `-subsumption to the problem of  finding a clique of fixed size in a graph,  and in return show that the pruning strategy  of the Carraghan and Pardalos clique  algorithm provides a dramatic reduction  of the subsumption search space. We also  present preliminary empirical results for  the mesh design data set.  1 Introduction  `-subsumption [ 19 ] is a correct but incomplete, decidable  consequence relation, while implication is  undecidable in general. A clause C `-subsumes D  (C ` ` D), iff there is a substitution `, such that  C` ` D.  `-subsumption is used as a consequence relation  in many ILP systems. Especially the consistency  test, i.e. the test if a newly generalized clause covers  negative samples, requires a large amount of subsumption  tests.  The `-subsumption of tw...
