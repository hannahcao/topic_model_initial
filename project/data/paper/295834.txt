We  used scenarios to explore issues in serendipitous  information such as privacy and work practice. Our sound  design was guided by a number of strategies for creating  peripheral sounds grouped in cohesive ecologies. Faced  with an physical and software infrastructure under  development in a laboratory distant from our sound studio,  we prototyped different sonic landscapes in VRML worlds.  In our infrastructure design, we made a number of trade-offs  in our use of legacy systems and our client-server design.  Keywords: Audio, Augmented Reality, Auditory Icons,  Active Badge, VRML.
