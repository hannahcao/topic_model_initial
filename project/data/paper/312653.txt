#abstract
Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, timeseries databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist proli#c patterns and#or long patterns. In this study,we propose a novel frequent pattern tree #FP-tree# structure, which is an extended pre#xtree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an e#cient FP-tree- based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. E#ciency of mining is achieved with three techniques: #1# a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, whichavoids costly, repeated database scans, #2# our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large n...<
