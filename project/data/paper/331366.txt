. In this paper, we address the problem of finding frequent itemsets in a database. Using the closed itemset lattice framework, we  show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of finding frequent  closed itemsets. Based on this statement, we can construct efficient data  mining algorithms by limiting the search space to the closed itemset  lattice rather than the subset lattice. Moreover, we show that the set of all  frequent closed itemsets suffices to determine a reduced set of association  rules, thus addressing another important data mining problem: limiting  the number of rules produced without information loss. We propose a new  algorithm, called A-Close, using a closure mechanism to find frequent  closed itemsets. We realized experiments to compare our approach to  the commonly used frequent itemset search approach. Those experiments  showed that our approach is very valuable for dense and/or correlated  data that represent an important part of existing databases.  1 I...
