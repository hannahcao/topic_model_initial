. In this paper, we describe two different learning tasks for relational structures. When learning a classifier for structures,  the relational structures in the training sets are classified as a whole.  Contrarily, when learning a context dependent classifier for elementary  objects, the elementary objects of the relational structures in  the training set are classified. We investigate the question how such  classifications can be induced automatically from a given training set  containing classified structures or classified elementary objects respectively.  We present an algorithm based on fast graph isomorphism  testing that allows the description of the objects in the training set by  automatically constructed attributes. This allows us to employ wellknown  methods of decision tree induction to construct a hypothesis.  We describe new simplification and structure reconstruction techniques  for the learned structural decision tree. We present the system  INDIGO and evaluate it on the Mesh and th...
