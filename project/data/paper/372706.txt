The extreme Programming methodology (XP) relies on co-located collaboration of programming  teams. This paper discusses problems and possible  solutions when distributed teams decide to do XP.  Communication and awareness support are the  keys to the successful distribution of programming  teams. The XP methodology is analysed  with respect to these essential issues. We present  TUKAN, which is a synchronous distributed team  programming environment, which applies groupware  research results to the XP domain and solves  the problems which arise when XP is carried out  by distributed teams.  Keywords  eXtreme Programming, CSCW, groupware, distribution,  awareness, communication, coordination,  TUKAN  1 Introduction  The eXtreme Programming (XP) methodology [1]  heavily relies on group members being co-located.  Rich communications within the team and a high  degree of awareness of the actions, which are performed  by others, are essential aspects of XP.  Unfortunately, co-located collaboration is not po...
