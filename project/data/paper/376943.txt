Software space dynamically adapts to the user`s  preferences and thus improves during usage. We will  illustrate how the adapted representation can assist users  in finding their way in software space.

Introduction  Hypertexts (such as a set of interwoven HTML documents)  have evolved as efficient media to impart complex  information to the reader. One problem in the reception of  hypertext is that of orientation. The question here is, how  a user can avoi...
