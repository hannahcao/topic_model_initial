#abstract
Context-enabled applications are just emerging and promise richer interaction by taking environmental context  into account. However, they are difficult to build due to  their distributed nature and the use of unconventional  sensors. The concepts of toolkits and widget libraries in  graphical user interfaces has been tremendously successful,  allowing programmers to leverage off existing building  blocks to build interactive systems more easily. We  introduce the concept of context widgets that mediate  between the environment and the application in the same  way graphical widgets mediate between the user and the  application. We illustrate the concept of context widgets  with the beginnings of a widget library we have developed  for sensing presence, identity and activity of people and  things. We assess the success of our approach with two  example context-enabled applications we have built and an  existing application to which we have added contextsensing  capabilities.
