#abstract
In the past, multi-user virtual environments have been developed as venues for entertainment and social interaction. Recent research focuses instead on their utility in carrying  out work in the real world. This research has identified the importance of a mapping between  the real and the virtual that permits the representation of real tasks in the virtual  environment. In this paper we investigate the use of virtual environments---in particular,  MUDs (Multi-User Dimensions)---in the domain of software process. In so doing,  we define a mapping, or metaphor, that permits the representation of software process  within a MUD. The system resulting from this mapping, called Promo, permits the  modeling and execution of software processes by geographically dispersed agents.
