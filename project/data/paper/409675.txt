. CEM is an email management system which stores its email in a concept lattice rather than in the usual tree structure. By using  such a conceptual multi-hierarchy, the system provides more flexibility in  retrieving stored emails. The paper presents the underlying mathematical  structures, discusses requirements for their maintenance and presents  their implementation.  1 Motivation  The way standard email management systems store mails is directly derived  from the tree structure of file management systems. This has the advantage that  trees have a simple structure which can easily be explained to novice users. The  disadvantage is that at the moment of storing an email the user already has  to foresee the way she is going to retrieve the mail later. The tree structure  forces her to decide at that moment which criteria to consider as primary and  which as secondary. For instance, when storing an email regarding the organization  of a conference, one has to decide whether to organize one'...
