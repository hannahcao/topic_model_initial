All generalisations within logic involve inverting implication. Yet, ever since Plotkin's work in the early 1970's methods of generalising first-order  clauses have involved inverting the clausal subsumption relationship. However,  even Plotkin realised that this approach was incomplete. Since inversion  of subsumption is central to many Inductive Logic Programming  approaches, this form of incompleteness has been propagated to techniques  such as Inverse Resolution and Relative Least General Generalisation. A  more complete approach to inverting implication has been attempted with  some success recently by Lapointe and Matwin. In the present paper the  author derives general solutions to this problem from first principles. It  is shown that clausal subsumption is only incomplete for self-recursive  clauses. Avoiding this incompleteness involves algorithms which find "nth  roots" of clauses. Completeness and correctness results are proved for a  non-deterministic algorithms which constructs nth ro...
