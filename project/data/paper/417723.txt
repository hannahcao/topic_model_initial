In this paper, we describe two different learning tasks for relational structures. When  learning a classifier for structures, the relational  structures in the training sets are classified  as a whole. Contrarily, when learning  a context dependent classifier for elementary  objects, the elementary objects of the relational  structures in the training set are classified.  In general, the class of an elementary  object will not only depend on its elementary  properties, but also on its context, which has  to be learned, too. We investigate the question  how such classifications can be induced  automatically from a given training set containing  classified structures or classified elementary  objects respectively. We present a  graph theoretic algorithm that allows the description  of the objects in the training set by  automatically constructed attributes. This  allows us to employ well-known methods of  decision tree induction to construct a hypothesis.  We present the system INDIGO ...
