We present an algorithm for the design of multiple Gabor filters for the segmentation of multi-textured images.  We draw upon earlier results that provide a segmentation  error measure based on the predicted vector  output statistics of multiple filter channels. This segmentation  error measure is used to design the filter  channels for a particular segmentation task. In our approach,  the filter parameters are free to vary from channel  to channel and are not restricted to some predetermined  decomposition of the frequency plane. Thus, our  method can generate more effective filter designs and  result in more effective features for image segmentation  than prior methods. Finally, we present texture  segmentation results that confirm the efficacy of the  proposed procedure. These results show effective segmentation  of 8 textures using as few as 2 filters, whereas  earlier approaches required 13 to 40 filters to segment  5 textures.  1. Introduction  We present a comprehensive procedure for the design...
