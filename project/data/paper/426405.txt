Shared environments beyond the desktop supporting face-to-face collaboration put new requirements on software: Users interact with multiple devices, and collaborate using different kinds of devices. The configuration of the devices is changing frequently due to the demands of new work practices in organizations which will be characterized by a high degree of dynamics, flexibility, and mobility. These are examples of requirements that have an impact on the architecture of the software infrastructure of these environments. BEACH, the software part of i--LAND (the ubiquitous computing environment at GMD-IPSI), uses an architecture designed to meet these requirements. It provides the functionality for synchronous cooperation and interaction with roomware components, i.e. room elements with integrated information technology. This paper discusses the software requirements for a roomware environment, and presents the architecture of BEACH. It closes with an overview of the current implement...<
