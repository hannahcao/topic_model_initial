HUMANOID is a user interface design tool that lets designers express abstract conceptualizations of an interface in an executable  form, allowing designers to experiment with scenarios  and dialogues even before the application model is  completely worked out. Three properties of the HUMANOID  approach allow it to do so: a modularization of design issues  into independent dimensions, support for multiple levels of  specificity in mapping application models to user interface  constructs, and mechanisms for constructing executable default  user interface implementations from whatever level of  specificity has been provided by the designer.  KEYWORDS: Design Processes, Development Tools and  Methods, User Interface Management Systems, Rapid Prototyping,  Interface Design Representation, Dialogue Specification.  INTRODUCTION  Interface design really begins much earlier than current  tools recognize. Long before a designer is ready to experiment  with presentation issues like the layout of widgets chosen...
