Texture is one of the most informative visual cues that help us understand our environment. Texture analysis is an important step in many  visual tasks, such as scene segmentation, object recognition, and shape  and depth perception. In this chapter we consider the problem of texture  recognition and provide an overview of our recent work on this topic  ([21, 19, 18]). Our method is based on representing textures in frequency  and orientation space, and using non-parametric learning schemes for classification.  We present state-of-the-art recognition results on a 30 texture  database and compare the performance of a rule-based network, the  k-nearest neighbor and feedforward neural-network classifiers. An important  extension to the system allows for rotation invariance. Experimental  results are presented for large-database rotation-invariant natural texture  recognition.  1. Introduction  Textures in an image are usually very apparent to a human observer (for example  see Fig. 1), but no simple m...
