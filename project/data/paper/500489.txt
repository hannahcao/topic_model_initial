#abstract
The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input  vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature  space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface  ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the supportvector  network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training  data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable  training data.
