Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying  the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among  them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent  itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms  utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery.  The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the  potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a  sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented,  which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all  their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database  layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques.  The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) d...
