Current user interface techniques such as WIMP or the desktop metaphor do not support real world tasks, because the  focus of these user interfaces is only on human--computer interactions,  not on human--real world interactions. In this paper,  we propose a method of building computer augmented  environments using a situation-aware portable device. This  device, called NaviCam, has the ability to recognize the user's  situation by detecting color-code IDs in real world environments.  It displays situation sensitive information by superimposing  messages on its video see-through screen. Combination  of ID-awareness and portable video-see-through display  solves several problems with current ubiquitous computers  systems and augmented reality systems.
