In this paper we investigate the efficiency of `-- subsumption (` ` ), the basic provability relation  in ILP. As D ` ` C is NP--complete even if we  restrict ourselves to linked Horn clauses and fix  C to contain only a small constant number of literals,  we investigate in several restrictions of D.  We first adapt the notion of determinate clauses  used in ILP and show that `--subsumption is decidable  in polynomial time if D is determinate  with respect to C. Secondly, we adapt the notion  of k--local Horn clauses and show that `--  subsumption is efficiently computable for some  reasonably small k. We then show how these  results can be combined, to give an efficient reasoning  procedure for determinate k--local Horn  clauses, an ILP--problem recently suggested to  be polynomial predictable by Cohen (1993) by  a simple counting argument. We finally outline  how the `--reduction algorithm, an essential part  of every lgg ILP--learning algorithm, can be improved  by these ideas.  1 INTRODUCTION  The...
