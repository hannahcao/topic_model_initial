: Systems coordinating distributed collaborative work must manage user data distributed over a network. The strong consistency algorithms which designers have typically  borrowed from the distributed systems community are often unsuited to the particular needs  of CSCW. Here, I outline an alternative approach based on divergence and synchronisation  between parallel streams of activity. From a CSCW perspective, this strategy offers three  primary advantages. First, it is scalable, allowing smooth transitions from highly interactive  collaboration to more extended, "asynchronous" styles of work. Second, it supports "multisynchronous  " work, in which parties work independently in parallel. Third, it directly supports  observed patterns of opportunistic activities in collaborative working.  Introduction: Distributed Data Management  Collaborative applications coordinate activities which may be distributed in time  and/or space. Distribution in time means that activities may take place at differen...
