Ripple down rules (RDR), that is rules with hierarchical exceptions, are used in knowledge acquisition because they provide a well intelligible and modifiable representation for even very  large expert systems. In this paper a formal semantics for RDRs is proposed, that covers  first order rules as well as attribute-value based rules. An algebraic foundation is proposed,  including simplification of RDRs and transformation of RDRs into flat lists of rules and ripple  down rule sets, hence these knowledge representation schemes are put into perspective. It is  shown, that a RDR has a shorter description length than an equivalent decision list.  Induction of rules with exceptions is characterized as bidirectional movement in the hypothesis  space, while known algorithms for learning rules or decision trees either perform a  top-down specialization of the most general or a bottom-up generalization of the most special  hypothesis. Known algorithms for induction of RDRs are summarized and compared  a...
