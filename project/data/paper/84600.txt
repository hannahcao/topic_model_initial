This paper addresses methods of specialising first-order theories within the context of incremental learning systems. We demonstrate the shortcomings  of existing first-order incremental learning systems with regard  to their specialisation mechanisms. We prove that these shortcomings are  fundamental to the use of classical logic. In particular, minimal "correcting  " specialisations are not always obtainable within this framework. We  propose instead the adoption of a specialisation scheme based on an existing  non-monotonic logic formalism. This approach overcomes the problems  that arise with incremental learning systems which employ classical logic.  As a side-effect of the formal proofs developed for this paper we define a  function called "deriv" which turns out to be an improvement on an existing  explanation-based-generalisation (EBG) algorithm. Prolog code and  a description of the relationship between "deriv" and the previous EBG  algorithm are described in an appendix.  1 Introduction  ...
