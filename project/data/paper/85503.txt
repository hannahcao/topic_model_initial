This paper is concerned with how collaborative virtual environments can be structured in order to enable greater  scalability and yet maintain a richness of communication.  Based on a survey of current work in this area a number of  important issues and design criteria are drawn out. In this  context a recent extension to the spatial model of interaction  called third party objects is described which can be  used to develop a variety of spatial structures which have  different effects on mutual awareness and communication.  These structures include nested regions and zones,  dynamic data districts and potentially mobile crowds of  participants. The paper also discusses how these structures  can be exploited by an underlying network architecture  based on a dynamically evolving hierarchy of  multicast groups and describes the MASSIVE-2 system  which implements it.  1. Introduction  Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) involve  the use of distributed virtual reality technology to support  cooperativ...
