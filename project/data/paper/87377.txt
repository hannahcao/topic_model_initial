We present a learning algorithm for rule-based concept representations called rippledown rule sets. Ripple-down rule sets allow us to deal with the exceptions for each  rule separately by introducing exception rules, exception rules for each exception rule  etc. up to a constant depth. These local exception rules are in contrast to decision  lists, in which the exception rules must be placed into a global ordering of the rules.  The localization of exceptions makes it possible to represent concepts that have no  decision list representation. On the other hand, decision lists with a constant number  of alternations between rules for different classes can be represented by constant depth  ripple-down rule sets with only a polynomial increase in size. Our algorithm is an  Occam algorithm for constant depth ripple-down rule sets and, hence, a PAC learning  algorithm. It is based on repeatedly applying the greedy approximation method for  the weighted set cover problem to find good exception rule set...
