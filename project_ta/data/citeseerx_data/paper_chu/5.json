Duplication of Publications The citation influence model treats the cited and the citing version of the same publication as completely independent from one another.

We want to know, whether the model assigns similar topic mixes to the duplicated publications, despite this independent treatment. For all duplicated publications, we compare the topic mixtures of both versions via the Jensen Shannon Divergence. The average divergence between duplicated publications is 0.07, which is very low compared to the average divergence between other topic mixtures of 0.69.

This can be provided by a meaningful visualization of the citation network that spins around some given publications. For example, consider researchers who read on a new topic with some references as starting points. The questions occur which other papers describe key contributions, how the various contributions relate to one another, and how the topic evolved over the past. Clearly, Google Scholar, CiteSeer and other tools that allow to navigate in the publication graph provide a great support and have made this task much easier. Inspired by the work of Garfield (2004), we would like to create a bird\u201aÄôs-eye visualization of a research area that complements in-depth navigation in the publication graph. But because the publication graph is linked densely, even a radius of two citations from a pivotal Appearing in Proceedings of the 24 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Corvallis, OR, 2007. Copyright 2007 by the author(s)/owner(s). paper contains hundreds of publications. When examining the citations in detail, one finds that not all cited work has a significant impact on a citing publication. Papers can be cited as background reading, for politeness, fear of receiving an adverse review from an aggrieved reviewer, or as related work that was argued against. For a detailed list of motivations for citing publications see Trigg (1983), Sandor et al. (2006). By contrast, a bird\u201aÄôs-eye visualization should show papers that significantly impact one another ( as is depicted in Figure 3). This requires to measure the strength of a citation\u201aÄôs influence on the citing work. This paper starts by formalizing the problem setting, followed by a discussion of related work. Section 4 describes baseline algorithms based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003). In Sections 5 and 6 we introduce generative models that directly model the influence of citations in paper collections. We also derive a Gibbs sampler that learns the model from data. Section 7 empirically evaluates the different models. The paper concludes with a discussion and outlook.

In the citation graph, vertices are publications, and a directed edge from node c to node d indicates that publication d cites publication c.

Weights Œ≥d(c) should correlate to the ground truth impact that c has had on d as strongly as possible. This ground truth is not observable.

Estimating the Influence of Citations with LDA In this section, we derive a baseline model based on LDA. Unsupervised Prediction of Citation Influences Two independence assumptions lead to this model. The first is the Markovian assumption that publications with a strong impact are directly cited. In this case, ancestors to not provide additional information over the directly linked papers. The LDA model is additionally based on the assumption that the topic mix of each paper is chosen independently of the topic mix of the papers that it cites. This leads to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model depicted in Figure 1a. Latent Dirichlet Allocation associates each token in a document with a latent variable that chooses one of the underlying topics in the corpus. This is achieved by associating each document d with a multinomial distribution Œ∏d = p(t|d) over latent topic variables t (also referred to as the topic mixture). Likewise, each topic variable t is associated with a multinomial distribution œÜt = p(w|t) over words w. In the LDA model, the strength of influence is not an integral part of the model (owing to the second independence assumption), but has to be determined in a later step using a heuristic measure. One heuristic (referred to as\u201aÄúLDA-JS\u201aÄù) defines the strength of influence as the compatibility between the topic mixtures of citing and cited publication. The compatibility of two topic mixtures is measured by the Jensen-Shannon- Divergence. The definition of the weight function is given in Equation 1. DKL(.||.) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Œ≥d(c) = exp(\u201aàíDJS(Œ∏dÔøΩŒ∏c)) , c \u201aàà L(d) (1) with DJS(Œ∏dÔøΩŒ∏c) = 1 2 DKL ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ Œ∏d ÔøΩ ÔøΩ Œ∏d ÔøΩÔøΩ + Œ∏c ÔøΩ ÔøΩ 2 ÔøΩ + 1 2 DKL ÔøΩ Œ∏c ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ Œ∏d ÔøΩÔøΩ + Œ∏c ÔøΩ ÔøΩ 2 ÔøΩ A second heuristic (denoted by \u201aÄúLDA-post\u201aÄù) uses the probability of a citation given the document p(c|d) as strenght of influence (Equation 2). We refer to p(d|t) as p(c|t), if c is a cited document, c \u201aàà L(d). With Bayes\u201aÄô rule and assuming a uniform prior p(c) the posterior of a cited document given a topic can be written as p(c|t) \u201aàù p(t|c). Œ≥d(c) =p(c|d) = ÔøΩ p(t, c|d) = ÔøΩ p(t|d) ¬∑ p(c|t) (2) 5. Copycat Model t The Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach assumes that citations do not influence the underlying topics. In contrast to this, the copycat model approximates a citing document by a \u201aÄúweighted sum\u201aÄù of documents it cites. The weights of the terms capture the notion of the influence Œ≥. In order to deal with synonyms and t Unsupervised Prediction of Citation Influences Figure 1. Approaches for estimating the influence of citations in plate notation. The citation influence model (c) combines Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a) and the copycat model (b) via the balancing parameter Œª. Figure 2. Association of words to the topical atmosphere (dashed circles) of cited publications. polysems we use latent topic variables t on a word level, just as in Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Each topic in a citing document is drawn from one of the topic mixtures of cited publications. The distribution of draws from cited publications is modeled by a multinomial over citations with parameter Œ≥. The model is depicted in plate notation in Figure 1b. While learning the parameters of the copycat model, a sampling algorithm associates each word of each citing publication d with a publication it cites. For example let there be a cited publication c which is cited by two publications d1 and d2. The topic mixture Œ∏c is not only about all words in the cited publication c but also about some words in d1 and d2, which are associated with c (cf. Figure 2). This way, the topic mixture Œ∏c is influenced by the citing publications, which in turn influences the association of words in d1 and d2 to c. All tokens that are associated with a cited publication are called the topical atmosphere of a cited publication. 5.1. Bipartite Citation Graph Following the Markov assumption that only the cited publications influence a citing publication, but not their ancestors, we transform the citation graph into a bipartite graph. The bipartite graph consists of two disjoint node sets D and C, where D contains only nodes with outgoing citation links (the citing publications) and C contains nodes with incoming links (the cited publications). Documents in the original citation graph with incoming and outgoing links are represented as two nodes d \u201aàà D and c \u201aàà C in the bipartite citation graph. 5.2. Mutual Influence of Citing Publications The generative process determines citation influences independently for each citing document, but during inference of the model all citing and all cited papers are considered cojointly. The model accounts for dependencies between cited and citing papers, but also between co-cited papers (papers cited by the same document) and bibliographically coupled papers (papers citing the same document). Furthermore, the topics are learned along with the influences. Because of bidirectional interdependence of links and topics caused by the topical atmosphere, publications originated in one research area (such as Gibbs sampling, which originated in physics) will also be associated with topics they are often cited by (such as machine learning). On the downside, if words in a citing publication do not fit well to the vocabulary introduced by the cited literature, those words will be associated to one of the citations randomly. As an implication, this brings new words and associated topics to the topical atmosphere of the cited publication, that are not reflected by the cited text and should be considered as noise. This will lead to unwanted effects in the prediction of citation influences. In the following chapter we introduce the citation influence model, which addresses this issue. Table 1.

Citation Influence Model If the model enforces each word in a citing publication to be associated with a cited publication, noise effects are introduced to the model which may impede the prediction. In addition, it is not possible to model innovation (i.e., new or evolving topics) in the copycat model. The citation influence model depicted in Figure 1c overcomes these limitations. A citing publication may choose to draw a word\u201aÄôs topic from a topic mixture of a citing publication Œ∏c (the topical atmosphere) or from it\u201aÄôs own topic mixture œàd that models innovative aspects. The choice is modeled by a flip of an unfair coin s. The parameter Œª of the coin is learned by the model, given an asymmetric beta prior ÔøΩŒ±Œª = (Œ±ŒªŒ∏ , Œ±Œªœà ) which prefers the topic mixture Œ∏ of a cited publication. The parameter Œª yields an estimate for how well a publication fits to all its citations. In combination with Œ≥, the relative influence of citations, Œª ¬∑ Œ≥ is a measure for the absolute strength of influence. The absolute measure allows to compare links from different citing publications. For the visualization, the citation graph can be thresholded according to the absolute measure.

For example, Cd,c,s(1, 2, 0) denotes the number of tokens in document 1 that are assigned to citation 2, where the coin result s is 0. The update equations which are used to learn the citation influence model are given in Table 2, see Appendix A for details about the derivation. After the sampling chain converges (i.e., after the burn-in phase), parameters that have been integrated out can be inferred from the count caches by averaging over the sampling chain after convergence.

For each number of topics, we compare the citation influence and copycat model with the LDA-based approaches in terms of the ability to predict the influence of citations.

Unlabeled citation links as well as those marked with \u201aÄú?\u201aÄù are excluded from the evaluation. The predictive performance of the models is analyzed by averaging AUC values for the test set of 22 manually labeled citing publications. The results are presented in Figure 4. Error bars indicate the standard error. We perform paired-t-tests for models with 15 topics with a significance level Œ± = 5%. This reveals that the citation influence model is always significantly better than the LDA-post heuristic (even for 15 topics). In contrast to this, the citation influence model is not significantly better than the copycat model, and the copycat model is not significantly better than the LDA-post heuristic. For 30 and 50 topics, where LDA starts to degenerate, the copycat model shows a significant improvement compared to the LDA-post heuristic. Furthermore, the LDA-JS heuristic is always slightly below the LDA-post heuristic in predicting citation influences. The approaches based on TF-IDF (AUC 0.45) and on PageRank (AUC 0.55) are not able to predict the strength of influence.  "}]}
